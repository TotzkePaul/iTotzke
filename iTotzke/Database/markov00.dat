  <string> a certain woman named lydia a seller of purple of the city of thyatira which worshipped god heard us  whose heart the lord opened that she attended unto the things which were spoken of paul</string>
  <string>
 when she was baptized and her household she besought us saying if ye have judged me to be faithful to the lord come into my house and abide there </string>
  <string> she constrained us</string>
  <string>
 it came to pass as we went to prayer a certain damsel possessed with a spirit of divination met us which brought her masters much gain by soothsaying
 the same followed paul and us and cried saying these men are the servants of the most high god which shew unto us the way of salvation</string>
  <string>
 this did she many days</string>
  <string> but paul being grieved turned and said to the spirit i command thee in the name of jesus christ to come out of her</string>
  <string> he came out the same hour</string>
  <string>
 when her masters saw that the hope of their gains was gone they caught paul and silas and drew them into the marketplace unto the rulers
 brought them to the magistrates saying these men being jews do exceedingly trouble our city
 teach customs which are not lawful for us to receive neither to observe being romans</string>
  <string>
 the multitude rose up together against them and the magistrates rent off their clothes and commanded to beat them </string>
  <string>
 when they had laid many stripes upon them they cast them into prison charging the jailor to keep them safely
 who having received such a charge thrust them into the inner prison and made their feet fast in the stocks</string>
  <string>
 at midnight paul and silas prayed and sang praises unto god and the prisoners heard them</string>
  <string>
 suddenly there was a great earthquake so that the foundations of the prison were shaken and immediately all the doors were opened and every one's bands were loosed</string>
  <string>
 the keeper of the prison awaking out of his sleep and seeing the prison doors open he drew out his sword and would have killed himself supposing that the prisoners had been fled</string>
  <string>
 but paul cried with a loud voice saying do thyself no harm for we are all here</string>
  <string>
 then he called for a light and sprang in and came trembling and fell down before paul and silas
 brought them out and said sirs what must i do to be saved</string>
  <string>
 they said believe on the lord jesus christ and thou shalt be saved and thy house</string>
  <string>
 they spake unto him the word of the lord and to all that were in his house</string>
  <string>
 he took them the same hour of the night and washed their stripes</string>
  <string> and was baptized he and all his straightway</string>
  <string>
 when he had brought them into his house he set meat before them and rejoiced believing in god with all his house</string>
  <string>
 when it was day the magistrates sent the serjeants saying let those men go</string>
  <string>
 the keeper of the prison told this saying to paul the magistrates have sent to let you go now therefore depart and go in peace</string>
  <string>
 but paul said unto them they have beaten us openly uncondemned being romans and have cast us into prison</string>
  <string> and now do they thrust us out privily</string>
  <string> nay verily</string>
  <string> but let them come themselves and fetch us out</string>
  <string>
 the serjeants told these words unto the magistrates and they feared when they heard that they were romans</string>
  <string>
 they came and besought them and brought them out and desired them to depart out of the city</string>
  <string>
 they went out of the prison and entered into the house of lydia and when they had seen the brethren they comforted them and departed</string>
  <string>
 
 now when they had passed through amphipolis and apollonia they came to thessalonica where was a synagogue of the jews
 paul as his manner was went in unto them and three sabbath days reasoned with them out of the scriptures
 opening and alleging that christ must needs have suffered and risen again from the dead</string>
  <string> and that this jesus whom i preach unto you is christ</string>
  <string>
 some of them believed and consorted with paul and silas</string>
  <string> and of the devout greeks a great multitude and of the chief women not a few</string>
  <string>
 but the jews which believed not moved with envy took unto them certain lewd fellows of the baser sort and gathered a company and set all the city on an uproar and assaulted the house of jason and sought to bring them out to the people</string>
  <string>
 when they found them not they drew jason and certain brethren unto the rulers of the city crying these that have turned the world upside down are come hither also</string>
  <string>
 whom jason hath received and these all do contrary to the decrees of caesar saying that there is another king one jesus</string>
  <string>
 they troubled the people and the rulers of the city when they heard these things</string>
  <string>
 when they had taken security of jason and of the other they let them go</string>
  <string>
 the brethren immediately sent away paul and silas by night unto berea who coming thither went into the synagogue of the jews</string>
  <string>
 these were more noble than those in thessalonica in that they received the word with all readiness of mind and searched the scriptures daily whether those things were so</string>
  <string>
 therefore many of them believed</string>
  <string> also of honourable women which were greeks and of men not a few</string>
  <string>
 but when the jews of thessalonica had knowledge that the word of god was preached of paul at berea they came thither also and stirred up the people</string>
  <string>
 then immediately the brethren sent away paul to go as it were to the sea but silas and timotheus abode there still</string>
  <string>
 they that conducted paul brought him unto athens and receiving a commandment unto silas and timotheus for to come to him with all speed they departed</string>
  <string>
 now while paul waited for them at athens his spirit was stirred in him when he saw the city wholly given to idolatry</string>
  <string>
 therefore disputed he in the synagogue with the jews and with the devout persons and in the market daily with them that met with him</string>
  <string>
 then certain philosophers of the epicureans and of the stoicks encountered him</string>
  <string> some said what will this babbler say</string>
  <string> other some he seemeth to be a setter forth of strange gods because he preached unto them jesus and the resurrection</string>
  <string>
 they took him and brought him unto areopagus saying may we know what this new doctrine whereof thou speakest is </string>
  <string>
 for thou bringest certain strange things to our ears we would know therefore what these things mean</string>
  <string>
 for all the athenians and strangers which were there spent their time in nothing else but either to tell or to hear some new thing</string>
  <string>
 then paul stood in the midst of mars' hill and said ye men of athens i perceive that in all things ye are too superstitious</string>
  <string>
 for as i passed by and beheld your devotions i found an altar with this inscription to the unknown god</string>
  <string> whom therefore ye ignorantly worship him declare i unto you</string>
  <string>
 god that made the world and all things therein seeing that he is lord of heaven and earth dwelleth not in temples made with hands</string>
  <string>
 neither is worshipped with men's hands as though he needed any thing seeing he giveth to all life and breath and all things</string>
  <string>
 hath made of one blood all nations of men for to dwell on all the face of the earth and hath determined the times before appointed and the bounds of their habitation</string>
  <string>
 that they should seek the lord if haply they might feel after him and find him though he be not far from every one of us
 for in him we live and move and have our being</string>
  <string> as certain also of your own poets have said for we are also his offspring</string>
  <string>
 forasmuch then as we are the offspring of god we ought not to think that the godhead is like unto gold or silver or stone graven by art and man's device</string>
  <string>
 the times of this ignorance god winked at</string>
  <string> but now commandeth all men every where to repent
 because he hath appointed a day in the which he will judge the world in righteousness by that man whom he hath ordained</string>
  <string> whereof he hath given assurance unto all men in that he hath raised him from the dead</string>
  <string>
 when they heard of the resurrection of the dead some mocked and others said we will hear thee again of this matter </string>
  <string>
 so paul departed from among them</string>
  <string>
 howbeit certain men clave unto him and believed among the which was dionysius the areopagite and a woman named damaris and others with them</string>
  <string>
 
 after these things paul departed from athens and came to corinth</string>
  <string>
 found a certain jew named aquila born in pontus lately come from italy with his wife priscilla</string>
  <string> because that claudius had commanded all jews to depart from rome and came unto them</string>
  <string>
 because he was of the same craft he abode with them and wrought for by their occupation they were tentmakers</string>
  <string>
 he reasoned in the synagogue every sabbath and persuaded the jews and the greeks</string>
  <string>
 when silas and timotheus were come from macedonia paul was pressed in the spirit and testified to the jews that jesus was christ</string>
  <string>
 when they opposed themselves and blasphemed he shook his raiment and said unto them your blood be upon your own heads</string>
  <string> i am clean from henceforth i will go unto the gentiles</string>
  <string>
 he departed thence and entered into a certain man's house named justus one that worshipped god whose house joined hard to the synagogue</string>
  <string>
 crispus the chief ruler of the synagogue believed on the lord with all his house</string>
  <string> and many of the corinthians hearing believed and were baptized</string>
  <string>
 then spake the lord to paul in the night by a vision be not afraid but speak and hold not thy peace
 for i am with thee and no man shall set on thee to hurt thee for i have much people in this city</string>
  <string>
 he continued there a year and six months teaching the word of god among them</string>
  <string>
 when gallio was the deputy of achaia the jews made insurrection with one accord against paul and brought him to the judgment seat
 saying this fellow persuadeth men to worship god contrary to the law</string>
  <string>
 when paul was now about to open his mouth gallio said unto the jews if it were a matter of wrong or wicked lewdness o ye jews reason would that i should bear with you
 but if it be a question of words and names and of your law look ye to it </string>
  <string> for i will be no judge of such matters </string>
  <string>
 he drave them from the judgment seat</string>
  <string>
 then all the greeks took sosthenes the chief ruler of the synagogue and beat him before the judgment seat</string>
  <string> gallio cared for none of those things</string>
  <string>
 paul after this tarried there yet a good while and then took his leave of the brethren and sailed thence into syria and with him priscilla and aquila</string>
  <string> having shorn his head in cenchrea for he had a vow</string>
  <string>
 he came to ephesus and left them there but he himself entered into the synagogue and reasoned with the jews</string>
  <string>
 when they desired him to tarry longer time with them he consented not</string>
  <string>
 but bade them farewell saying i must by all means keep this feast that cometh in jerusalem but i will return again unto you if god will</string>
  <string> he sailed from ephesus</string>
  <string>
 when he had landed at caesarea and gone up and saluted the church he went down to antioch</string>
  <string>
 after he had spent some time there he departed and went over all the country of galatia and phrygia in order strengthening all the disciples</string>
  <string>
 a certain jew named apollos born at alexandria an eloquent man and mighty in the scriptures came to ephesus</string>
  <string>
 this man was instructed in the way of the lord</string>
  <string> and being fervent in the spirit he spake and taught diligently the things of the lord knowing only the baptism of john</string>
  <string>
 he began to speak boldly in the synagogue whom when aquila and priscilla had heard they took him unto them and expounded unto him the way of god more perfectly</string>
  <string>
 when he was disposed to pass into achaia the brethren wrote exhorting the disciples to receive him who when he was come helped them much which had believed through grace
 for he mightily convinced the jews and that publickly shewing by the scriptures that jesus was christ</string>
  <string>
 
 it came to pass that while apollos was at corinth paul having passed through the upper coasts came to ephesus and finding certain disciples
 he said unto them have ye received the holy ghost since ye believed</string>
  <string> they said unto him we have not so much as heard whether there be any holy ghost</string>
  <string>
 he said unto them unto what then were ye baptized</string>
  <string> they said unto john's baptism</string>
  <string>
 then said paul john verily baptized with the baptism of repentance saying unto the people that they should believe on him which should come after him that is on christ jesus</string>
  <string>
 when they heard this they were baptized in the name of the lord jesus</string>
  <string>
 when paul had laid his hands upon them the holy ghost came on them</string>
  <string> and they spake with tongues and prophesied</string>
  <string>
 all the men were about twelve</string>
  <string>
 he went into the synagogue and spake boldly for the space of three months disputing and persuading the things concerning the kingdom of god</string>
  <string>
 but when divers were hardened and believed not but spake evil of that way before the multitude he departed from them and separated the disciples disputing daily in the school of one tyrannus</string>
  <string>
 this continued by the space of two years</string>
  <string> so that all they which dwelt in asia heard the word of the lord jesus both jews and greeks</string>
  <string>
 god wrought special miracles by the hands of paul
 so that from his body were brought unto the sick handkerchiefs or aprons and the diseases departed from them and the evil spirits went out of them</string>
  <string>
 then certain of the vagabond jews exorcists took upon them to call over them which had evil spirits the name of the lord jesus saying we adjure you by jesus whom paul preacheth</string>
  <string>
 there were seven sons of one sceva a jew and chief of the priests which did so</string>
  <string>
 the evil spirit answered and said jesus i know and paul i know</string>
  <string> but who are ye</string>
  <string>
 the man in whom the evil spirit was leaped on them and overcame them and prevailed against them so that they fled out of that house naked and wounded</string>
  <string>
 this was known to all the jews and greeks also dwelling at ephesus</string>
  <string> and fear fell on them all and the name of the lord jesus was magnified</string>
  <string>
 many that believed came and confessed and shewed their deeds</string>
  <string>
 many of them also which used curious arts brought their books together and burned them before all men  and they counted the price of them and found it fifty thousand pieces of silver</string>
  <string>
 so mightily grew the word of god and prevailed</string>
  <string>
 after these things were ended paul purposed in the spirit when he had passed through macedonia and achaia to go to jerusalem saying after i have been there i must also see rome</string>
  <string>
 so he sent into macedonia two of them that ministered unto him timotheus and erastus</string>
  <string> but he himself stayed in asia for a season</string>
  <string>
 the same time there arose no small stir about that way</string>
  <string>
 for a certain man named demetrius a silversmith which made silver shrines for diana brought no small gain unto the craftsmen</string>
  <string>
 whom he called together with the workmen of like occupation and said sirs ye know that by this craft we have our wealth</string>
  <string>
 moreover ye see and hear that not alone at ephesus but almost throughout all asia this paul hath persuaded and turned away much people saying that they be no gods which are made with hands
 so that not only this our craft is in danger to be set at nought</string>
  <string> but also that the temple of the great goddess diana should be despised and her magnificence should be destroyed whom all asia and the world worshippeth</string>
  <string>
 when they heard these sayings they were full of wrath and cried out saying great is diana of the ephesians</string>
  <string>
 the whole city was filled with confusion and having caught gaius and aristarchus men of macedonia paul's companions in travel they rushed with one accord into the theatre</string>
  <string>
 when paul would have entered in unto the people the disciples suffered him not</string>
  <string>
 certain of the chief of asia which were his friends sent unto him desiring him that he would not adventure himself into the theatre</string>
  <string>
 some therefore cried one thing and some another for the assembly was confused</string>
  <string> and the more part knew not wherefore they were come together</string>
  <string>
 they drew alexander out of the multitude the jews putting him forward</string>
  <string> alexander beckoned with the hand and would have made his defence unto the people</string>
  <string>
 but when they knew that he was a jew all with one voice about the space of two hours cried out great is diana of the ephesians</string>
  <string>
 when the townclerk had appeased the people he said ye men of ephesus what man is there that knoweth not how that the city of the ephesians is a worshipper of the great goddess diana and of the image which fell down from jupiter</string>
  <string>
 seeing then that these things cannot be spoken against ye ought to be quiet and to do nothing rashly</string>
  <string>
 for ye have brought hither these men which are neither robbers of churches nor yet blasphemers of your goddess</string>
  <string>
 wherefore if demetrius and the craftsmen which are with him have a matter against any man the law is open and there are deputies let them implead one another</string>
  <string>
 but if ye enquire any thing concerning other matters it shall be determined in a lawful assembly</string>
  <string>
 for we are in danger to be called in question for this day's uproar there being no cause whereby we may give an account of this concourse</string>
  <string>
 when he had thus spoken he dismissed the assembly</string>
  <string>
 
 after the uproar was ceased paul called unto him the disciples and embraced them and departed for to go into macedonia</string>
  <string>
 when he had gone over those parts and had given them much exhortation he came into greece
 there abode three months</string>
  <string> when the jews laid wait for him as he was about to sail into syria he purposed to return through macedonia</string>
  <string>
 there accompanied him into asia sopater of berea</string>
  <string> and of the thessalonians aristarchus and secundus</string>
  <string> and gaius of derbe and timotheus</string>
  <string> and of asia tychicus and trophimus</string>
  <string>
 these going before tarried for us at troas</string>
  <string>
 we sailed away from philippi after the days of unleavened bread and came unto them to troas in five days</string>
  <string> where we abode seven days</string>
  <string>
 upon the first day of the week when the disciples came together to break bread paul preached unto them ready to depart on the morrow</string>
  <string> and continued his speech until midnight</string>
  <string>
 there were many lights in the upper chamber where they were gathered together</string>
  <string>
 there sat in a window a certain young man named eutychus being fallen into a deep sleep and as paul was long preaching he sunk down with sleep and fell down from the third loft and was taken up dead</string>
  <string>
 paul went down and fell on him and embracing him said trouble not yourselves</string>
  <string> for his life is in him</string>
  <string>
 when he therefore was come up again and had broken bread and eaten and talked a long while even till break of day so he departed</string>
  <string>
 they brought the young man alive and were not a little comforted</string>
  <string>
 we went before to ship and sailed unto assos there intending to take in paul for so had he appointed minding himself to go afoot</string>
  <string>
 when he met with us at assos we took him in and came to mitylene</string>
  <string>
 we sailed thence and came the next day over against chios</string>
  <string> and the next day we arrived at samos and tarried at trogyllium</string>
  <string> and the next day we came to miletus</string>
  <string>
 for paul had determined to sail by ephesus because he would not spend the time in asia for he hasted if it were possible for him to be at jerusalem the day of pentecost</string>
  <string>
 from miletus he sent to ephesus and called the elders of the church</string>
  <string>
 when they were come to him he said unto them ye know from the first day that i came into asia after what manner i have been with you at all seasons
 serving the lord with all humility of mind and with many tears and temptations which befell me by the lying in wait of the jews
 how i kept back nothing that was profitable unto you but have shewed you and have taught you publickly and from house to house
 testifying both to the jews and also to the greeks repentance toward god and faith toward our lord jesus christ</string>
  <string>
 now behold i go bound in the spirit unto jerusalem not knowing the things that shall befall me there
 save that the holy ghost witnesseth in every city saying that bonds and afflictions abide me</string>
  <string>
 but none of these things move me neither count i my life dear unto myself so that i might finish my course with joy and the ministry which i have received of the lord jesus to testify the gospel of the grace of god</string>
  <string>
 now behold i know that ye all among whom i have gone preaching the kingdom of god shall see my face no more</string>
  <string>
 wherefore i take you to record this day that i am pure from the blood of all men </string>
  <string>
 for i have not shunned to declare unto you all the counsel of god</string>
  <string>
 take heed therefore unto yourselves and to all the flock over the which the holy ghost hath made you overseers to feed the church of god which he hath purchased with his own blood</string>
  <string>
 for i know this that after my departing shall grievous wolves enter in among you not sparing the flock</string>
  <string>
 also of your own selves shall men arise speaking perverse things to draw away disciples after them</string>
  <string>
 therefore watch and remember that by the space of three years i ceased not to warn every one night and day with tears</string>
  <string>
 now brethren i commend you to god and to the word of his grace which is able to build you up and to give you an inheritance among all them which are sanctified</string>
  <string>
 i have coveted no man's silver or gold or apparel</string>
  <string>
 yea ye yourselves know that these hands have ministered unto my necessities and to them that were with me</string>
  <string>
 i have shewed you all things how that so labouring ye ought to support the weak and to remember the words of the lord jesus how he said it is more blessed to give than to receive</string>
  <string>
 when he had thus spoken he kneeled down and prayed with them all</string>
  <string>
 they all wept sore and fell on paul's neck and kissed him
 sorrowing most of all for the words which he spake that they should see his face no more</string>
  <string> they accompanied him unto the ship</string>
  <string>
 
 it came to pass that after we were gotten from them and had launched we came with a straight course unto coos and the day following unto rhodes and from thence unto patara
 finding a ship sailing over unto phenicia we went aboard and set forth</string>
  <string>
 now when we had discovered cyprus we left it on the left hand and sailed into syria and landed at tyre for there the ship was to unlade her burden</string>
  <string>
 finding disciples we tarried there seven days who said to paul through the spirit that he should not go up to jerusalem</string>
  <string>
 when we had accomplished those days we departed and went our way</string>
  <string> and they all brought us on our way with wives and children till we were out of the city and we kneeled down on the shore and prayed</string>
  <string>
 when we had taken our leave one of another we took ship</string>
  <string> and they returned home again</string>
  <string>
 when we had finished our course from tyre we came to ptolemais and saluted the brethren and abode with them one day</string>
  <string>
 the next day we that were of paul's company departed and came unto caesarea and we entered into the house of philip the evangelist which was one of the seven</string>
  <string> and abode with him</string>
  <string>
 the same man had four daughters virgins which did prophesy</string>
  <string>
 as we tarried there many days there came down from judaea a certain prophet named agabus</string>
  <string>
 when he was come unto us he took paul's girdle and bound his own hands and feet and said thus saith the holy ghost so shall the jews at jerusalem bind the man that owneth this girdle and shall deliver him into the hands of the gentiles</string>
  <string>
 when we heard these things both we and they of that place besought him not to go up to jerusalem</string>
  <string>
 then paul answered what mean ye to weep and to break mine heart</string>
  <string> for i am ready not to be bound only but also to die at jerusalem for the name of the lord jesus</string>
  <string>
 when he would not be persuaded we ceased saying the will of the lord be done</string>
  <string>
 after those days we took up our carriages and went up to jerusalem</string>
  <string>
 there went with us also certain of the disciples of caesarea and brought with them one mnason of cyprus an old disciple with whom we should lodge</string>
  <string>
 when we were come to jerusalem the brethren received us gladly</string>
  <string>
 the day following paul went in with us unto james</string>
  <string> and all the elders were present</string>
  <string>
 when he had saluted them he declared particularly what things god had wrought among the gentiles by his ministry</string>
  <string>
 when they heard it they glorified the lord and said unto him thou seest brother how many thousands of jews there are which believe</string>
  <string> and they are all zealous of the law
 they are informed of thee that thou teachest all the jews which are among the gentiles to forsake moses saying that they ought not to circumcise their children neither to walk after the customs</string>
  <string>
 what is it therefore</string>
  <string> the multitude must needs come together for they will hear that thou art come</string>
  <string>
 do therefore this that we say to thee we have four men which have a vow on them</string>
  <string>
 them take and purify thyself with them and be at charges with them that they may shave their heads and all may know that those things whereof they were informed concerning thee are nothing</string>
  <string> but that thou thyself also walkest orderly and keepest the law</string>
  <string>
 as touching the gentiles which believe we have written and concluded that they observe no such thing save only that they keep themselves from things offered to idols and from blood and from strangled and from fornication</string>
  <string>
 then paul took the men and the next day purifying himself with them entered into the temple to signify the accomplishment of the days of purification until that an offering should be offered for every one of them</string>
  <string>
 when the seven days were almost ended the jews which were of asia when they saw him in the temple stirred up all the people and laid hands on him
 crying out men of israel help this is the man that teacheth all men every where against the people and the law and this place and further brought greeks also into the temple and hath polluted this holy place</string>
  <string>
 for they had seen before with him in the city trophimus an ephesian whom they supposed that paul had brought into the temple</string>
  <string>
 all the city was moved and the people ran together and they took paul and drew him out of the temple and forthwith the doors were shut</string>
  <string>
 as they went about to kill him tidings came unto the chief captain of the band that all jerusalem was in an uproar</string>
  <string>
 who immediately took soldiers and centurions and ran down unto them and when they saw the chief captain and the soldiers they left beating of paul</string>
  <string>
 then the chief captain came near and took him and commanded him to be bound with two chains</string>
  <string> and demanded who he was and what he had done</string>
  <string>
 some cried one thing some another among the multitude and when he could not know the certainty for the tumult he commanded him to be carried into the castle</string>
  <string>
 when he came upon the stairs so it was that he was borne of the soldiers for the violence of the people</string>
  <string>
 for the multitude of the people followed after crying away with him</string>
  <string>
 as paul was to be led into the castle he said unto the chief captain may i speak unto thee</string>
  <string> who said canst thou speak greek</string>
  <string>
 art not thou that egyptian which before these days madest an uproar and leddest out into the wilderness four thousand men that were murderers</string>
  <string>
 but paul said i am a man which am a jew of tarsus a city in cilicia a citizen of no mean city and i beseech thee suffer me to speak unto the people</string>
  <string>
 when he had given him licence paul stood on the stairs and beckoned with the hand unto the people</string>
  <string> when there was made a great silence he spake unto them in the hebrew tongue saying
 
 men brethren and fathers hear ye my defence which i make now unto you</string>
  <string>
  when they heard that he spake in the hebrew tongue to them they kept the more silence and he saith
 i am verily a man which am a jew born in tarsus a city in cilicia yet brought up in this city at the feet of gamaliel and taught according to the perfect manner of the law of the fathers and was zealous toward god as ye all are this day</string>
  <string>
 i persecuted this way unto the death binding and delivering into prisons both men and women</string>
  <string>
 as also the high priest doth bear me witness and all the estate of the elders from whom also i received letters unto the brethren and went to damascus to bring them which were there bound unto jerusalem for to be punished</string>
  <string>
 it came to pass that as i made my journey and was come nigh unto damascus about noon suddenly there shone from heaven a great light round about me</string>
  <string>
 i fell unto the ground and heard a voice saying unto me saul saul why persecutest thou me</string>
  <string>
 i answered who art thou lord</string>
  <string> he said unto me i am jesus of nazareth whom thou persecutest</string>
  <string>
 they that were with me saw indeed the light and were afraid</string>
  <string> but they heard not the voice of him that spake to me</string>
  <string>
 i said what shall i do lord</string>
  <string> the lord said unto me arise and go into damascus</string>
  <string> and there it shall be told thee of all things which are appointed for thee to do</string>
  <string>
 when i could not see for the glory of that light being led by the hand of them that were with me i came into damascus</string>
  <string>
 one ananias a devout man according to the law having a good report of all the jews which dwelt there 
 came unto me and stood and said unto me brother saul receive thy sight</string>
  <string> the same hour i looked up upon him</string>
  <string>
 he said the god of our fathers hath chosen thee that thou shouldest know his will and see that just one and shouldest hear the voice of his mouth</string>
  <string>
 for thou shalt be his witness unto all men of what thou hast seen and heard</string>
  <string>
 now why tarriest thou</string>
  <string> arise and be baptized and wash away thy sins calling on the name of the lord</string>
  <string>
 it came to pass that when i was come again to jerusalem even while i prayed in the temple i was in a trance</string>
  <string>
 saw him saying unto me make haste and get thee quickly out of jerusalem for they will not receive thy testimony concerning me</string>
  <string>
 i said lord they know that i imprisoned and beat in every synagogue them that believed on thee
 when the blood of thy martyr stephen was shed i also was standing by and consenting unto his death and kept the raiment of them that slew him</string>
  <string>
 he said unto me depart for i will send thee far hence unto the gentiles</string>
  <string>
 they gave him audience unto this word and then lifted up their voices and said away with such a fellow from the earth for it is not fit that he should live</string>
  <string>
 as they cried out and cast off their clothes and threw dust into the air
 the chief captain commanded him to be brought into the castle and bade that he should be examined by scourging</string>
  <string> that he might know wherefore they cried so against him</string>
  <string>
 as they bound him with thongs paul said unto the centurion that stood by is it lawful for you to scourge a man that is a roman and uncondemned</string>
  <string>
 when the centurion heard that he went and told the chief captain saying take heed what thou doest for this man is a roman</string>
  <string>
 then the chief captain came and said unto him tell me art thou a roman</string>
  <string> he said yea</string>
  <string>
 the chief captain answered with a great sum obtained i this freedom</string>
  <string> paul said but i was free born</string>
  <string>
 then straightway they departed from him which should have examined him and the chief captain also was afraid after he knew that he was a roman and because he had bound him</string>
  <string>
 on the morrow because he would have known the certainty wherefore he was accused of the jews he loosed him from his bands and commanded the chief priests and all their council to appear and brought paul down and set him before them</string>
  <string>
 
 paul earnestly beholding the council said men and brethren i have lived in all good conscience before god until this day</string>
  <string>
 the high priest ananias commanded them that stood by him to smite him on the mouth</string>
  <string>
 then said paul unto him god shall smite thee thou whited wall for sittest thou to judge me after the law and commandest me to be smitten contrary to the law</string>
  <string>
 they that stood by said revilest thou god's high priest</string>
  <string>
 then said paul i wist not brethren that he was the high priest for it is written thou shalt not speak evil of the ruler of thy people</string>
  <string>
 but when paul perceived that the one part were sadducees and the other pharisees he cried out in the council men and brethren i am a pharisee the son of a pharisee of the hope and resurrection of the dead i am called in question</string>
  <string>
 when he had so said there arose a dissension between the pharisees and the sadducees and the multitude was divided</string>
  <string>
 for the sadducees say that there is no resurrection neither angel nor spirit but the pharisees confess both</string>
  <string>
 there arose a great cry and the scribes that were of the pharisees' part arose and strove saying we find no evil in this man but if a spirit or an angel hath spoken to him let us not fight against god</string>
  <string>
 when there arose a great dissension the chief captain fearing lest paul should have been pulled in pieces of them commanded the soldiers to go down and to take him by force from among them and to bring him into the castle</string>
  <string>
 the night following the lord stood by him and said be of good cheer paul for as thou hast testified of me in jerusalem so must thou bear witness also at rome</string>
  <string>
 when it was day certain of the jews banded together and bound themselves under a curse saying that they would neither eat nor drink till they had killed paul</string>
  <string>
 they were more than forty which had made this conspiracy</string>
  <string>
 they came to the chief priests and elders and said we have bound ourselves under a great curse that we will eat nothing until we have slain paul</string>
  <string>
 now therefore ye with the council signify to the chief captain that he bring him down unto you to morrow as though ye would enquire something more perfectly concerning him and we or ever he come near are ready to kill him</string>
  <string>
 when paul's sister's son heard of their lying in wait he went and entered into the castle and told paul</string>
  <string>
 then paul called one of the centurions unto him and said bring this young man unto the chief captain for he hath a certain thing to tell him</string>
  <string>
 so he took him and brought him to the chief captain and said paul the prisoner called me unto him and prayed me to bring this young man unto thee who hath something to say unto thee</string>
  <string>
 then the chief captain took him by the hand and went with him aside privately and asked him what is that thou hast to tell me</string>
  <string>
 he said the jews have agreed to desire thee that thou wouldest bring down paul to morrow into the council as though they would enquire somewhat of him more perfectly</string>
  <string>
 but do not thou yield unto them for there lie in wait for him of them more than forty men which have bound themselves with an oath that they will neither eat nor drink till they have killed him and now are they ready looking for a promise from thee</string>
  <string>
 so the chief captain then let the young man depart and charged him see thou tell no man that thou hast shewed these things to me</string>
  <string>
 he called unto him two centurions saying make ready two hundred soldiers to go to caesarea and horsemen threescore and ten and spearmen two hundred at the third hour of the night</string>
  <string>
 provide them beasts that they may set paul on and bring him safe unto felix the governor</string>
  <string>
 he wrote a letter after this manner
 claudius lysias unto the most excellent governor felix sendeth greeting</string>
  <string>
 this man was taken of the jews and should have been killed of them then came i with an army and rescued him having understood that he was a roman</string>
  <string>
 when i would have known the cause wherefore they accused him i brought him forth into their council
 whom i perceived to be accused of questions of their law but to have nothing laid to his charge worthy of death or of bonds</string>
  <string>
 when it was told me how that the jews laid wait for the man i sent straightway to thee and gave commandment to his accusers also to say before thee what they had against him</string>
  <string> farewell</string>
  <string>
 then the soldiers as it was commanded them took paul and brought him by night to antipatris</string>
  <string>
 on the morrow they left the horsemen to go with him and returned to the castle
 who when they came to caesarea and delivered the epistle to the governor presented paul also before him</string>
  <string>
 when the governor had read the letter he asked of what province he was</string>
  <string> when he understood that he was of cilicia</string>
  <string>
 i will hear thee said he when thine accusers are also come</string>
  <string> he commanded him to be kept in herod's judgment hall</string>
  <string>
 
 after five days ananias the high priest descended with the elders and with a certain orator named tertullus who informed the governor against paul</string>
  <string>
 when he was called forth tertullus began to accuse him saying seeing that by thee we enjoy great quietness and that very worthy deeds are done unto this nation by thy providence
 we accept it always and in all places most noble felix with all thankfulness</string>
  <string>
 notwithstanding that i be not further tedious unto thee i pray thee that thou wouldest hear us of thy clemency a few words</string>
  <string>
 for we have found this man a pestilent fellow and a mover of sedition among all the jews throughout the world and a ringleader of the sect of the nazarenes
 who also hath gone about to profane the temple whom we took and would have judged according to our law</string>
  <string>
 but the chief captain lysias came upon us and with great violence took him away out of our hands
 commanding his accusers to come unto thee by examining of whom thyself mayest take knowledge of all these things whereof we accuse him</string>
  <string>
 the jews also assented saying that these things were so</string>
  <string>
 then paul after that the governor had beckoned unto him to speak answered forasmuch as i know that thou hast been of many years a judge unto this nation i do the more cheerfully answer for myself
 because that thou mayest understand that there are yet but twelve days since i went up to jerusalem for to worship</string>
  <string>
 they neither found me in the temple disputing with any man neither raising up the people neither in the synagogues nor in the city
 neither can they prove the things whereof they now accuse me</string>
  <string>
 but this i confess unto thee that after the way which they call heresy so worship i the god of my fathers believing all things which are written in the law and in the prophets
 have hope toward god which they themselves also allow that there shall be a resurrection of the dead both of the just and unjust</string>
  <string>
 herein do i exercise myself to have always a conscience void of offence toward god and toward men</string>
  <string>
 now after many years i came to bring alms to my nation and offerings</string>
  <string>
 whereupon certain jews from asia found me purified in the temple neither with multitude nor with tumult</string>
  <string>
 who ought to have been here before thee and object if they had ought against me</string>
  <string>
 or else let these same here say if they have found any evil doing in me while i stood before the council
 except it be for this one voice that i cried standing among them touching the resurrection of the dead i am called in question by you this day</string>
  <string>
 when felix heard these things having more perfect knowledge of that way he deferred them and said when lysias the chief captain shall come down i will know the uttermost of your matter</string>
  <string>
 he commanded a centurion to keep paul and to let him have liberty and that he should forbid none of his acquaintance to minister or come unto him</string>
  <string>
 after certain days when felix came with his wife drusilla which was a jewess he sent for paul and heard him concerning the faith in christ</string>
  <string>
 as he reasoned of righteousness temperance and judgment to come felix trembled and answered go thy way for this time</string>
  <string> when i have a convenient season i will call for thee</string>
  <string>
 he hoped also that money should have been given him of paul that he might loose him wherefore he sent for him the oftener and communed with him</string>
  <string>
 but after two years porcius festus came into felix' room and felix willing to shew the jews a pleasure left paul bound</string>
  <string>
 
 now when festus was come into the province after three days he ascended from caesarea to jerusalem</string>
  <string>
 then the high priest and the chief of the jews informed him against paul and besought him
 desired favour against him that he would send for him to jerusalem laying wait in the way to kill him</string>
  <string>
 but festus answered that paul should be kept at caesarea and that he himself would depart shortly thither </string>
  <string>
 let them therefore said he which among you are able go down with me and accuse this man if there be any wickedness in him</string>
  <string>
 when he had tarried among them more than ten days he went down unto caesarea</string>
  <string> and the next day sitting on the judgment seat commanded paul to be brought</string>
  <string>
 when he was come the jews which came down from jerusalem stood round about and laid many and grievous complaints against paul which they could not prove</string>
  <string>
 while he answered for himself neither against the law of the jews neither against the temple nor yet against caesar have i offended any thing at all</string>
  <string>
 but festus willing to do the jews a pleasure answered paul and said wilt thou go up to jerusalem and there be judged of these things before me</string>
  <string>
 then said paul i stand at caesar's judgment seat where i ought to be judged to the jews have i done no wrong as thou very well knowest</string>
  <string>
 for if i be an offender or have committed any thing worthy of death i refuse not to die but if there be none of these things whereof these accuse me no man may deliver me unto them</string>
  <string> i appeal unto caesar</string>
  <string>
 then festus when he had conferred with the council answered hast thou appealed unto caesar</string>
  <string> unto caesar shalt thou go</string>
  <string>
 after certain days king agrippa and bernice came unto caesarea to salute festus</string>
  <string>
 when they had been there many days festus declared paul's cause unto the king saying there is a certain man left in bonds by felix
 about whom when i was at jerusalem the chief priests and the elders of the jews informed me desiring to have judgment against him</string>
  <string>
 to whom i answered it is not the manner of the romans to deliver any man to die before that he which is accused have the accusers face to face and have licence to answer for himself concerning the crime laid against him</string>
  <string>
 therefore when they were come hither without any delay on the morrow i sat on the judgment seat and commanded the man to be brought forth</string>
  <string>
 against whom when the accusers stood up they brought none accusation of such things as i supposed
 but had certain questions against him of their own superstition and of one jesus which was dead whom paul affirmed to be alive</string>
  <string>
 because i doubted of such manner of questions i asked him whether he would go to jerusalem and there be judged of these matters</string>
  <string>
 but when paul had appealed to be reserved unto the hearing of augustus i commanded him to be kept till i might send him to caesar</string>
  <string>
 then agrippa said unto festus i would also hear the man myself</string>
  <string> to morrow said he thou shalt hear him</string>
  <string>
 on the morrow when agrippa was come and bernice with great pomp and was entered into the place of hearing with the chief captains and principal men of the city at festus' commandment paul was brought forth</string>
  <string>
 festus said king agrippa and all men which are here present with us ye see this man about whom all the multitude of the jews have dealt with me both at jerusalem and also here crying that he ought not to live any longer</string>
  <string>
 but when i found that he had committed nothing worthy of death and that he himself hath appealed to augustus i have determined to send him</string>
  <string>
 of whom i have no certain thing to write unto my lord</string>
  <string> wherefore i have brought him forth before you and specially before thee o king agrippa that after examination had i might have somewhat to write</string>
  <string>
 for it seemeth to me unreasonable to send a prisoner and not withal to signify the crimes laid against him</string>
  <string>
 
 then agrippa said unto paul thou art permitted to speak for thyself</string>
  <string> then paul stretched forth the hand and answered for himself
 i think myself happy king agrippa because i shall answer for myself this day before thee touching all the things whereof i am accused of the jews
 especially because i know thee to be expert in all customs and questions which are among the jews wherefore i beseech thee to hear me patiently</string>
  <string>
 my manner of life from my youth which was at the first among mine own nation at jerusalem know all the jews</string>
  <string>
 which knew me from the beginning if they would testify that after the most straitest sect of our religion i lived a pharisee</string>
  <string>
 now i stand and am judged for the hope of the promise made of god unto our fathers
 unto which promise our twelve tribes instantly serving god day and night hope to come</string>
  <string> for which hope's sake king agrippa i am accused of the jews</string>
  <string>
 why should it be thought a thing incredible with you that god should raise the dead</string>
  <string>
 i verily thought with myself that i ought to do many things contrary to the name of jesus of nazareth</string>
  <string>
 which thing i also did in jerusalem and many of the saints did i shut up in prison having received authority from the chief priests</string>
  <string> and when they were put to death i gave my voice against them </string>
  <string>
 i punished them oft in every synagogue and compelled them to blaspheme</string>
  <string> and being exceedingly mad against them i persecuted them even unto strange cities</string>
  <string>
 whereupon as i went to damascus with authority and commission from the chief priests
 at midday o king i saw in the way a light from heaven above the brightness of the sun shining round about me and them which journeyed with me</string>
  <string>
 when we were all fallen to the earth i heard a voice speaking unto me and saying in the hebrew tongue saul saul why persecutest thou me</string>
  <string> it is hard for thee to kick against the pricks</string>
  <string>
 i said who art thou lord</string>
  <string> he said i am jesus whom thou persecutest</string>
  <string>
 but rise and stand upon thy feet for i have appeared unto thee for this purpose to make thee a minister and a witness both of these things which thou hast seen and of those things in the which i will appear unto thee</string>
  <string>
 delivering thee from the people and from the gentiles unto whom now i send thee
 to open their eyes and to turn them from darkness to light and from the power of satan unto god that they may receive forgiveness of sins and inheritance among them which are sanctified by faith that is in me</string>
  <string>
 whereupon o king agrippa i was not disobedient unto the heavenly vision
 but shewed first unto them of damascus and at jerusalem and throughout all the coasts of judaea and then to the gentiles that they should repent and turn to god and do works meet for repentance</string>
  <string>
 for these causes the jews caught me in the temple and went about to kill me </string>
  <string>
 having therefore obtained help of god i continue unto this day witnessing both to small and great saying none other things than those which the prophets and moses did say should come
 that christ should suffer and that he should be the first that should rise from the dead and should shew light unto the people and to the gentiles</string>
  <string>
 as he thus spake for himself festus said with a loud voice paul thou art beside thyself</string>
  <string> much learning doth make thee mad</string>
  <string>
 but he said i am not mad most noble festus</string>
  <string> but speak forth the words of truth and soberness</string>
  <string>
 for the king knoweth of these things before whom also i speak freely for i am persuaded that none of these things are hidden from him</string>
  <string> for this thing was not done in a corner</string>
  <string>
 king agrippa believest thou the prophets</string>
  <string> i know that thou believest</string>
  <string>
 then agrippa said unto paul almost thou persuadest me to be a christian</string>
  <string>
 paul said i would to god that not only thou but also all that hear me this day were both almost and altogether such as i am except these bonds</string>
  <string>
 when he had thus spoken the king rose up and the governor and bernice and they that sat with them
 when they were gone aside they talked between themselves saying this man doeth nothing worthy of death or of bonds</string>
  <string>
 then said agrippa unto festus this man might have been set at liberty if he had not appealed unto caesar</string>
  <string>
 
 when it was determined that we should sail into italy they delivered paul and certain other prisoners unto one named julius a centurion of augustus' band</string>
  <string>
 entering into a ship of adramyttium we launched meaning to sail by the coasts of asia</string>
  <string> one aristarchus a macedonian of thessalonica being with us</string>
  <string>
 the next day we touched at sidon</string>
  <string> julius courteously entreated paul and gave him liberty to go unto his friends to refresh himself</string>
  <string>
 when we had launched from thence we sailed under cyprus because the winds were contrary</string>
  <string>
 when we had sailed over the sea of cilicia and pamphylia we came to myra a city of lycia</string>
  <string>
 there the centurion found a ship of alexandria sailing into italy</string>
  <string> and he put us therein</string>
  <string>
 when we had sailed slowly many days and scarce were come over against cnidus the wind not suffering us we sailed under crete over against salmone</string>
  <string>
 hardly passing it came unto a place which is called the fair havens</string>
  <string> nigh whereunto was the city of lasea</string>
  <string>
 now when much time was spent and when sailing was now dangerous because the fast was now already past paul admonished them 
 said unto them sirs i perceive that this voyage will be with hurt and much damage not only of the lading and ship but also of our lives</string>
  <string>
 nevertheless the centurion believed the master and the owner of the ship more than those things which were spoken by paul</string>
  <string>
 because the haven was not commodious to winter in the more part advised to depart thence also if by any means they might attain to phenice and there to winter</string>
  <string> which is an haven of crete and lieth toward the south west and north west</string>
  <string>
 when the south wind blew softly supposing that they had obtained their purpose loosing thence they sailed close by crete</string>
  <string>
 but not long after there arose against it a tempestuous wind called euroclydon</string>
  <string>
 when the ship was caught and could not bear up into the wind we let her drive</string>
  <string>
 running under a certain island which is called clauda we had much work to come by the boat
 which when they had taken up they used helps undergirding the ship</string>
  <string> and fearing lest they should fall into the quicksands strake sail and so were driven</string>
  <string>
 we being exceedingly tossed with a tempest the next day they lightened the ship</string>
  <string>
 the third day we cast out with our own hands the tackling of the ship</string>
  <string>
 when neither sun nor stars in many days appeared and no small tempest lay on us all hope that we should be saved was then taken away</string>
  <string>
 but after long abstinence paul stood forth in the midst of them and said sirs ye should have hearkened unto me and not have loosed from crete and to have gained this harm and loss</string>
  <string>
 now i exhort you to be of good cheer for there shall be no loss of any man's life among you but of the ship</string>
  <string>
 for there stood by me this night the angel of god whose i am and whom i serve
 saying fear not paul</string>
  <string> thou must be brought before caesar and lo god hath given thee all them that sail with thee</string>
  <string>
 wherefore sirs be of good cheer for i believe god that it shall be even as it was told me</string>
  <string>
 howbeit we must be cast upon a certain island</string>
  <string>
 but when the fourteenth night was come as we were driven up and down in adria about midnight the shipmen deemed that they drew near to some country</string>
  <string>
 sounded and found it twenty fathoms and when they had gone a little further they sounded again and found it fifteen fathoms</string>
  <string>
 then fearing lest we should have fallen upon rocks they cast four anchors out of the stern and wished for the day</string>
  <string>
 as the shipmen were about to flee out of the ship when they had let down the boat into the sea under colour as though they would have cast anchors out of the foreship
 paul said to the centurion and to the soldiers except these abide in the ship ye cannot be saved</string>
  <string>
 then the soldiers cut off the ropes of the boat and let her fall off</string>
  <string>
 while the day was coming on paul besought them all to take meat saying this day is the fourteenth day that ye have tarried and continued fasting having taken nothing</string>
  <string>
 wherefore i pray you to take some meat for this is for your health for there shall not an hair fall from the head of any of you</string>
  <string>
 when he had thus spoken he took bread and gave thanks to god in presence of them all and when he had broken it he began to eat</string>
  <string>
 then were they all of good cheer and they also took some meat</string>
  <string>
 we were in all in the ship two hundred threescore and sixteen souls</string>
  <string>
 when they had eaten enough they lightened the ship and cast out the wheat into the sea</string>
  <string>
 when it was day they knew not the land but they discovered a certain creek with a shore into the which they were minded if it were possible to thrust in the ship</string>
  <string>
 when they had taken up the anchors they committed themselves unto the sea and loosed the rudder bands and hoised up the mainsail to the wind and made toward shore</string>
  <string>
 falling into a place where two seas met they ran the ship aground</string>
  <string> and the forepart stuck fast and remained unmoveable but the hinder part was broken with the violence of the waves</string>
  <string>
 the soldiers' counsel was to kill the prisoners lest any of them should swim out and escape</string>
  <string>
 but the centurion willing to save paul kept them from their purpose</string>
  <string> and commanded that they which could swim should cast themselves first into the sea and get to land
 the rest some on boards and some on broken pieces of the ship</string>
  <string> so it came to pass that they escaped all safe to land</string>
  <string>
 
 when they were escaped then they knew that the island was called melita</string>
  <string>
 the barbarous people shewed us no little kindness for they kindled a fire and received us every one because of the present rain and because of the cold</string>
  <string>
 when paul had gathered a bundle of sticks and laid them on the fire there came a viper out of the heat and fastened on his hand</string>
  <string>
 when the barbarians saw the venomous beast hang on his hand they said among themselves no doubt this man is a murderer whom though he hath escaped the sea yet vengeance suffereth not to live</string>
  <string>
 he shook off the beast into the fire and felt no harm</string>
  <string>
 howbeit they looked when he should have swollen or fallen down dead suddenly but after they had looked a great while and saw no harm come to him they changed their minds and said that he was a god</string>
  <string>
 in the same quarters were possessions of the chief man of the island whose name was publius</string>
  <string> who received us and lodged us three days courteously</string>
  <string>
 it came to pass that the father of publius lay sick of a fever and of a bloody flux to whom paul entered in and prayed and laid his hands on him and healed him</string>
  <string>
 so when this was done others also which had diseases in the island came and were healed
 who also honoured us with many honours</string>
  <string> and when we departed they laded us with such things as were necessary</string>
  <string>
 after three months we departed in a ship of alexandria which had wintered in the isle whose sign was castor and pollux</string>
  <string>
 landing at syracuse we tarried there three days</string>
  <string>
 from thence we fetched a compass and came to rhegium and after one day the south wind blew and we came the next day to puteoli
 where we found brethren and were desired to tarry with them seven days and so we went toward rome</string>
  <string>
 from thence when the brethren heard of us they came to meet us as far as appii forum and the three taverns whom when paul saw he thanked god and took courage</string>
  <string>
 when we came to rome the centurion delivered the prisoners to the captain of the guard but paul was suffered to dwell by himself with a soldier that kept him</string>
  <string>
 it came to pass that after three days paul called the chief of the jews together and when they were come together he said unto them men and brethren though i have committed nothing against the people or customs of our fathers yet was i delivered prisoner from jerusalem into the hands of the romans</string>
  <string>
 who when they had examined me would have let me go because there was no cause of death in me</string>
  <string>
 but when the jews spake against it i was constrained to appeal unto caesar</string>
  <string> not that i had ought to accuse my nation of</string>
  <string>
 for this cause therefore have i called for you to see you and to speak with you  because that for the hope of israel i am bound with this chain</string>
  <string>
 they said unto him we neither received letters out of judaea concerning thee neither any of the brethren that came shewed or spake any harm of thee</string>
  <string>
 but we desire to hear of thee what thou thinkest for as concerning this sect we know that every where it is spoken against</string>
  <string>
 when they had appointed him a day there came many to him into his lodging</string>
  <string> to whom he expounded and testified the kingdom of god persuading them concerning jesus both out of the law of moses and out of the prophets from morning till evening</string>
  <string>
 some believed the things which were spoken and some believed not</string>
  <string>
 when they agreed not among themselves they departed after that paul had spoken one word well spake the holy ghost by esaias the prophet unto our fathers
 saying go unto this people and say hearing ye shall hear and shall not understand</string>
  <string> and seeing ye shall see and not perceive
 for the heart of this people is waxed gross and their ears are dull of hearing and their eyes have they closed</string>
  <string> lest they should see with their eyes and hear with their ears and understand with their heart and should be converted and i should heal them</string>
  <string>
 be it known therefore unto you that the salvation of god is sent unto the gentiles and that they will hear it</string>
  <string>
 when he had said these words the jews departed and had great reasoning among themselves</string>
  <string>
 paul dwelt two whole years in his own hired house and received all that came in unto him
 preaching the kingdom of god and teaching those things which concern the lord jesus christ with all confidence no man forbidding him</string>
  <string>
 the epistle of paul the apostle to the romans
 
 paul a servant of jesus christ called to be an apostle separated unto the gospel of god
 which he had promised afore by his prophets in the holy scriptures
 concerning his son jesus christ our lord which was made of the seed of david according to the flesh</string>
  <string>
 declared to be the son of god with power according to the spirit of holiness by the resurrection from the dead
 by whom we have received grace and apostleship for obedience to the faith among all nations for his name
 among whom are ye also the called of jesus christ
 to all that be in rome beloved of god called to be saints grace to you and peace from god our father and the lord jesus christ</string>
  <string>
 first i thank my god through jesus christ for you all that your faith is spoken of throughout the whole world</string>
  <string>
 for god is my witness whom i serve with my spirit in the gospel of his son that without ceasing i make mention of you always in my prayers</string>
  <string>
 making request if by any means now at length i might have a prosperous journey by the will of god to come unto you</string>
  <string>
 for i long to see you that i may impart unto you some spiritual gift to the end ye may be established</string>
  <string>
 that is that i may be comforted together with you by the mutual faith both of you and me</string>
  <string>
 now i would not have you ignorant brethren that oftentimes i purposed to come unto you but was let hitherto that i might have some fruit among you also even as among other gentiles</string>
  <string>
 i am debtor both to the greeks and to the barbarians</string>
  <string> both to the wise and to the unwise</string>
  <string>
 so as much as in me is i am ready to preach the gospel to you that are at rome also</string>
  <string>
 for i am not ashamed of the gospel of christ for it is the power of god unto salvation to every one that believeth</string>
  <string> to the jew first and also to the greek</string>
  <string>
 for therein is the righteousness of god revealed from faith to faith as it is written the just shall live by faith</string>
  <string>
 for the wrath of god is revealed from heaven against all ungodliness and unrighteousness of men who hold the truth in unrighteousness</string>
  <string>
 because that which may be known of god is manifest in them</string>
  <string> for god hath shewed it unto them</string>
  <string>
 for the invisible things of him from the creation of the world are clearly seen being understood by the things that are made even his eternal power and godhead</string>
  <string> so that they are without excuse
 because that when they knew god they glorified him not as god neither were thankful</string>
  <string> but became vain in their imaginations and their foolish heart was darkened</string>
  <string>
 professing themselves to be wise they became fools
 changed the glory of the uncorruptible god into an image made like to corruptible man and to birds and fourfooted beasts and creeping things</string>
  <string>
 wherefore god also gave them up to uncleanness through the lusts of their own hearts to dishonour their own bodies between themselves
 who changed the truth of god into a lie and worshipped and served the creature more than the creator who is blessed for ever</string>
  <string> amen</string>
  <string>
 for this cause god gave them up unto vile affections for even their women did change the natural use into that which is against nature
 likewise also the men leaving the natural use of the woman burned in their lust one toward another</string>
  <string> men with men working that which is unseemly and receiving in themselves that recompence of their error which was meet</string>
  <string>
 even as they did not like to retain god in their knowledge god gave them over to a reprobate mind to do those things which are not convenient</string>
  <string>
 being filled with all unrighteousness fornication wickedness covetousness maliciousness</string>
  <string> full of envy murder debate deceit malignity</string>
  <string> whisperers
 backbiters haters of god despiteful proud boasters inventors of evil things disobedient to parents
 without understanding covenantbreakers without natural affection implacable unmerciful
 who knowing the judgment of god that they which commit such things are worthy of death not only do the same but have pleasure in them that do them</string>
  <string>
 
 therefore thou art inexcusable o man whosoever thou art that judgest for wherein thou judgest another thou condemnest thyself</string>
  <string> for thou that judgest doest the same things</string>
  <string>
 but we are sure that the judgment of god is according to truth against them which commit such things</string>
  <string>
 thinkest thou this o man that judgest them which do such things and doest the same that thou shalt escape the judgment of god</string>
  <string>
 or despisest thou the riches of his goodness and forbearance and longsuffering</string>
  <string> not knowing that the goodness of god leadeth thee to repentance</string>
  <string>
 but after thy hardness and impenitent heart treasurest up unto thyself wrath against the day of wrath and revelation of the righteous judgment of god</string>
  <string>
 who will render to every man according to his deeds
 to them who by patient continuance in well doing seek for glory and honour and immortality eternal life
 but unto them that are contentious and do not obey the truth but obey unrighteousness indignation and wrath
 tribulation and anguish upon every soul of man that doeth evil of the jew first and also of the gentile</string>
  <string>
 but glory honour and peace to every man that worketh good to the jew first and also to the gentile
 for there is no respect of persons with god</string>
  <string>
 for as many as have sinned without law shall also perish without law and as many as have sinned in the law shall be judged by the law</string>
  <string>
 for not the hearers of the law are just before god but the doers of the law shall be justified</string>
  <string>
 for when the gentiles which have not the law do by nature the things contained in the law these having not the law are a law unto themselves
 which shew the work of the law written in their hearts their conscience also bearing witness and their thoughts the mean while accusing or else excusing one another</string>
  <string>
 in the day when god shall judge the secrets of men by jesus christ according to my gospel</string>
  <string>
 behold thou art called a jew and restest in the law and makest thy boast of god
 knowest his will and approvest the things that are more excellent being instructed out of the law</string>
  <string>
 art confident that thou thyself art a guide of the blind a light of them which are in darkness
 an instructor of the foolish a teacher of babes which hast the form of knowledge and of the truth in the law</string>
  <string>
 thou therefore which teachest another teachest thou not thyself</string>
  <string> thou that preachest a man should not steal dost thou steal</string>
  <string>
 thou that sayest a man should not commit adultery dost thou commit adultery</string>
  <string> thou that abhorrest idols dost thou commit sacrilege</string>
  <string>
 thou that makest thy boast of the law through breaking the law dishonourest thou god</string>
  <string>
 for the name of god is blasphemed among the gentiles through you as it is written</string>
  <string>
 for circumcision verily profiteth if thou keep the law but if thou be a breaker of the law thy circumcision is made uncircumcision</string>
  <string>
 therefore if the uncircumcision keep the righteousness of the law shall not his uncircumcision be counted for circumcision</string>
  <string>
 shall not uncircumcision which is by nature if it fulfil the law judge thee who by the letter and circumcision dost transgress the law</string>
  <string>
 for he is not a jew which is one outwardly</string>
  <string> neither is that circumcision which is outward in the flesh
 but he is a jew which is one inwardly</string>
  <string> and circumcision is that of the heart in the spirit and not in the letter</string>
  <string> whose praise is not of men but of god</string>
  <string>
 
 what advantage then hath the jew</string>
  <string> or what profit is there of circumcision</string>
  <string>
 much every way chiefly because that unto them were committed the oracles of god</string>
  <string>
 for what if some did not believe</string>
  <string> shall their unbelief make the faith of god without effect</string>
  <string>
 god forbid yea let god be true but every man a liar</string>
  <string> as it is written that thou mightest be justified in thy sayings and mightest overcome when thou art judged</string>
  <string>
 but if our unrighteousness commend the righteousness of god what shall we say</string>
  <string> is god unrighteous who taketh vengeance</string>
  <string> i speak as a man
 god forbid for then how shall god judge the world</string>
  <string>
 for if the truth of god hath more abounded through my lie unto his glory</string>
  <string> why yet am i also judged as a sinner</string>
  <string>
 not rather as we be slanderously reported and as some affirm that we say let us do evil that good may come</string>
  <string> whose damnation is just</string>
  <string>
 what then</string>
  <string> are we better than they </string>
  <string> no in no wise for we have before proved both jews and gentiles that they are all under sin</string>
  <string>
 as it is written there is none righteous no not one
 there is none that understandeth there is none that seeketh after god</string>
  <string>
 they are all gone out of the way they are together become unprofitable</string>
  <string> there is none that doeth good no not one</string>
  <string>
 their throat is an open sepulchre</string>
  <string> with their tongues they have used deceit</string>
  <string> the poison of asps is under their lips
 whose mouth is full of cursing and bitterness
 their feet are swift to shed blood
 destruction and misery are in their ways
 the way of peace have they not known
 there is no fear of god before their eyes</string>
  <string>
 now we know that what things soever the law saith it saith to them who are under the law that every mouth may be stopped and all the world may become guilty before god</string>
  <string>
 therefore by the deeds of the law there shall no flesh be justified in his sight for by the law is the knowledge of sin</string>
  <string>
 but now the righteousness of god without the law is manifested being witnessed by the law and the prophets</string>
  <string>
 even the righteousness of god which is by faith of jesus christ unto all and upon all them that believe for there is no difference
 for all have sinned and come short of the glory of god</string>
  <string>
 being justified freely by his grace through the redemption that is in christ jesus
 whom god hath set forth to be a propitiation through faith in his blood to declare his righteousness for the remission of sins that are past through the forbearance of god</string>
  <string>
 to declare i say at this time his righteousness that he might be just and the justifier of him which believeth in jesus</string>
  <string>
 where is boasting then</string>
  <string> it is excluded</string>
  <string> by what law</string>
  <string> of works</string>
  <string> nay but by the law of faith</string>
  <string>
 therefore we conclude that a man is justified by faith without the deeds of the law</string>
  <string>
 is he the god of the jews only</string>
  <string> is he not also of the gentiles</string>
  <string> yes of the gentiles also
 seeing it is one god which shall justify the circumcision by faith and uncircumcision through faith</string>
  <string>
 do we then make void the law through faith</string>
  <string> god forbid yea we establish the law</string>
  <string>
 
 what shall we say then that abraham our father as pertaining to the flesh hath found</string>
  <string>
 for if abraham were justified by works he hath whereof to glory</string>
  <string> but not before god</string>
  <string>
 for what saith the scripture</string>
  <string> abraham believed god and it was counted unto him for righteousness</string>
  <string>
 now to him that worketh is the reward not reckoned of grace but of debt</string>
  <string>
 but to him that worketh not but believeth on him that justifieth the ungodly his faith is counted for righteousness</string>
  <string>
 even as david also describeth the blessedness of the man unto whom god imputeth righteousness without works
 saying blessed are they whose iniquities are forgiven and whose sins are covered</string>
  <string>
 blessed is the man to whom the lord will not impute sin</string>
  <string>
 cometh this blessedness then upon the circumcision only or upon the uncircumcision also</string>
  <string> for we say that faith was reckoned to abraham for righteousness</string>
  <string>
 how was it then reckoned</string>
  <string> when he was in circumcision or in uncircumcision</string>
  <string> not in circumcision but in uncircumcision</string>
  <string>
 he received the sign of circumcision a seal of the righteousness of the faith which he had yet being uncircumcised that he might be the father of all them that believe though they be not circumcised</string>
  <string> that righteousness might be imputed unto them also
 the father of circumcision to them who are not of the circumcision only but who also walk in the steps of that faith of our father abraham which he had being yet uncircumcised</string>
  <string>
 for the promise that he should be the heir of the world was not to abraham or to his seed through the law but through the righteousness of faith</string>
  <string>
 for if they which are of the law be heirs faith is made void and the promise made of none effect
 because the law worketh wrath for where no law is there is no transgression</string>
  <string>
 therefore it is of faith that it might be by grace</string>
  <string> to the end the promise might be sure to all the seed</string>
  <string> not to that only which is of the law but to that also which is of the faith of abraham</string>
  <string> who is the father of us all
 as it is written i have made thee a father of many nations before him whom he believed even god who quickeneth the dead and calleth those things which be not as though they were</string>
  <string>
 who against hope believed in hope that he might become the father of many nations according to that which was spoken so shall thy seed be</string>
  <string>
 being not weak in faith he considered not his own body now dead when he was about an hundred years old neither yet the deadness of sara's womb
 he staggered not at the promise of god through unbelief</string>
  <string> but was strong in faith giving glory to god</string>
  <string>
 being fully persuaded that what he had promised he was able also to perform</string>
  <string>
 therefore it was imputed to him for righteousness</string>
  <string>
 now it was not written for his sake alone that it was imputed to him</string>
  <string>
 but for us also to whom it shall be imputed if we believe on him that raised up jesus our lord from the dead</string>
  <string>
 who was delivered for our offences and was raised again for our justification</string>
  <string>
 
 therefore being justified by faith we have peace with god through our lord jesus christ
 by whom also we have access by faith into this grace wherein we stand and rejoice in hope of the glory of god</string>
  <string>
 not only so but we glory in tribulations also knowing that tribulation worketh patience</string>
  <string>
 patience experience</string>
  <string> and experience hope
 hope maketh not ashamed</string>
  <string> because the love of god is shed abroad in our hearts by the holy ghost which is given unto us</string>
  <string>
 for when we were yet without strength in due time christ died for the ungodly</string>
  <string>
 for scarcely for a righteous man will one die yet peradventure for a good man some would even dare to die</string>
  <string>
 but god commendeth his love toward us in that while we were yet sinners christ died for us</string>
  <string>
 much more then being now justified by his blood we shall be saved from wrath through him</string>
  <string>
 for if when we were enemies we were reconciled to god by the death of his son much more being reconciled we shall be saved by his life</string>
  <string>
 not only so but we also joy in god through our lord jesus christ by whom we have now received the atonement</string>
  <string>
 wherefore as by one man sin entered into the world and death by sin</string>
  <string> and so death passed upon all men for that all have sinned
 for until the law sin was in the world but sin is not imputed when there is no law</string>
  <string>
 nevertheless death reigned from adam to moses even over them that had not sinned after the similitude of adam's transgression who is the figure of him that was to come</string>
  <string>
 but not as the offence so also is the free gift</string>
  <string> for if through the offence of one many be dead much more the grace of god and the gift by grace which is by one man jesus christ hath abounded unto many</string>
  <string>
 not as it was by one that sinned so is the gift for the judgment was by one to condemnation but the free gift is of many offences unto justification</string>
  <string>
 for if by one man's offence death reigned by one</string>
  <string> much more they which receive abundance of grace and of the gift of righteousness shall reign in life by one jesus christ</string>
  <string>
 therefore as by the offence of one judgment came upon all men to condemnation</string>
  <string> even so by the righteousness of one the free gift came upon all men unto justification of life</string>
  <string>
 for as by one man's disobedience many were made sinners so by the obedience of one shall many be made righteous</string>
  <string>
 moreover the law entered that the offence might abound</string>
  <string> but where sin abounded grace did much more abound
 that as sin hath reigned unto death even so might grace reign through righteousness unto eternal life by jesus christ our lord</string>
  <string>
 
 what shall we say then</string>
  <string> shall we continue in sin that grace may abound</string>
  <string>
 god forbid</string>
  <string> how shall we that are dead to sin live any longer therein</string>
  <string>
 know ye not that so many of us as were baptized into jesus christ were baptized into his death</string>
  <string>
 therefore we are buried with him by baptism into death that like as christ was raised up from the dead by the glory of the father even so we also should walk in newness of life</string>
  <string>
 for if we have been planted together in the likeness of his death we shall be also in the likeness of his resurrection
 knowing this that our old man is crucified with him that the body of sin might be destroyed that henceforth we should not serve sin</string>
  <string>
 for he that is dead is freed from sin</string>
  <string>
 now if we be dead with christ we believe that we shall also live with him
 knowing that christ being raised from the dead dieth no more</string>
  <string> death hath no more dominion over him</string>
  <string>
 for in that he died he died unto sin once but in that he liveth he liveth unto god</string>
  <string>
 likewise reckon ye also yourselves to be dead indeed unto sin but alive unto god through jesus christ our lord</string>
  <string>
 let not sin therefore reign in your mortal body that ye should obey it in the lusts thereof</string>
  <string>
 neither yield ye your members as instruments of unrighteousness unto sin but yield yourselves unto god as those that are alive from the dead and your members as instruments of righteousness unto god</string>
  <string>
 for sin shall not have dominion over you for ye are not under the law but under grace</string>
  <string>
 what then</string>
  <string> shall we sin because we are not under the law but under grace</string>
  <string> god forbid</string>
  <string>
 know ye not that to whom ye yield yourselves servants to obey his servants ye are to whom ye obey</string>
  <string> whether of sin unto death or of obedience unto righteousness</string>
  <string>
 but god be thanked that ye were the servants of sin but ye have obeyed from the heart that form of doctrine which was delivered you</string>
  <string>
 being then made free from sin ye became the servants of righteousness</string>
  <string>
 i speak after the manner of men because of the infirmity of your flesh for as ye have yielded your members servants to uncleanness and to iniquity unto iniquity</string>
  <string> even so now yield your members servants to righteousness unto holiness</string>
  <string>
 for when ye were the servants of sin ye were free from righteousness</string>
  <string>
 what fruit had ye then in those things whereof ye are now ashamed</string>
  <string> for the end of those things is death</string>
  <string>
 but now being made free from sin and become servants to god ye have your fruit unto holiness and the end everlasting life</string>
  <string>
 for the wages of sin is death</string>
  <string> but the gift of god is eternal life through jesus christ our lord</string>
  <string>
 
 know ye not brethren for i speak to them that know the law how that the law hath dominion over a man as long as he liveth</string>
  <string>
 for the woman which hath an husband is bound by the law to her husband so long as he liveth</string>
  <string> but if the husband be dead she is loosed from the law of her husband</string>
  <string>
 so then if while her husband liveth she be married to another man she shall be called an adulteress but if her husband be dead she is free from that law</string>
  <string> so that she is no adulteress though she be married to another man</string>
  <string>
 wherefore my brethren ye also are become dead to the law by the body of christ</string>
  <string> that ye should be married to another even to him who is raised from the dead that we should bring forth fruit unto god</string>
  <string>
 for when we were in the flesh the motions of sins which were by the law did work in our members to bring forth fruit unto death</string>
  <string>
 but now we are delivered from the law that being dead wherein we were held</string>
  <string> that we should serve in newness of spirit and not in the oldness of the letter</string>
  <string>
 what shall we say then</string>
  <string> is the law sin</string>
  <string> god forbid</string>
  <string> nay i had not known sin but by the law for i had not known lust except the law had said thou shalt not covet</string>
  <string>
 but sin taking occasion by the commandment wrought in me all manner of concupiscence</string>
  <string> for without the law sin was dead</string>
  <string>
 for i was alive without the law once but when the commandment came sin revived and i died</string>
  <string>
 the commandment which was ordained to life i found to be unto death</string>
  <string>
 for sin taking occasion by the commandment deceived me and by it slew me </string>
  <string>
 wherefore the law is holy and the commandment holy and just and good</string>
  <string>
 was then that which is good made death unto me</string>
  <string> god forbid</string>
  <string> but sin that it might appear sin working death in me by that which is good</string>
  <string> that sin by the commandment might become exceeding sinful</string>
  <string>
 for we know that the law is spiritual but i am carnal sold under sin</string>
  <string>
 for that which i do i allow not for what i would that do i not</string>
  <string> but what i hate that do i</string>
  <string>
 if then i do that which i would not i consent unto the law that it is good</string>
  <string>
 now then it is no more i that do it but sin that dwelleth in me</string>
  <string>
 for i know that in me that is in my flesh dwelleth no good thing for to will is present with me</string>
  <string> but how to perform that which is good i find not</string>
  <string>
 for the good that i would i do not but the evil which i would not that i do</string>
  <string>
 now if i do that i would not it is no more i that do it but sin that dwelleth in me</string>
  <string>
 i find then a law that when i would do good evil is present with me</string>
  <string>
 for i delight in the law of god after the inward man
 but i see another law in my members warring against the law of my mind and bringing me into captivity to the law of sin which is in my members</string>
  <string>
 o wretched man that i am</string>
  <string> who shall deliver me from the body of this death</string>
  <string>
 i thank god through jesus christ our lord</string>
  <string> so then with the mind i myself serve the law of god</string>
  <string> but with the flesh the law of sin</string>
  <string>
 
 there is therefore now no condemnation to them which are in christ jesus who walk not after the flesh but after the spirit</string>
  <string>
 for the law of the spirit of life in christ jesus hath made me free from the law of sin and death</string>
  <string>
 for what the law could not do in that it was weak through the flesh god sending his own son in the likeness of sinful flesh and for sin condemned sin in the flesh
 that the righteousness of the law might be fulfilled in us who walk not after the flesh but after the spirit</string>
  <string>
 for they that are after the flesh do mind the things of the flesh</string>
  <string> but they that are after the spirit the things of the spirit</string>
  <string>
 for to be carnally minded is death</string>
  <string> but to be spiritually minded is life and peace</string>
  <string>
 because the carnal mind is enmity against god for it is not subject to the law of god neither indeed can be</string>
  <string>
 so then they that are in the flesh cannot please god</string>
  <string>
 but ye are not in the flesh but in the spirit if so be that the spirit of god dwell in you</string>
  <string> now if any man have not the spirit of christ he is none of his</string>
  <string>
 if christ be in you the body is dead because of sin</string>
  <string> but the spirit is life because of righteousness</string>
  <string>
 but if the spirit of him that raised up jesus from the dead dwell in you he that raised up christ from the dead shall also quicken your mortal bodies by his spirit that dwelleth in you</string>
  <string>
 therefore brethren we are debtors not to the flesh to live after the flesh</string>
  <string>
 for if ye live after the flesh ye shall die but if ye through the spirit do mortify the deeds of the body ye shall live</string>
  <string>
 for as many as are led by the spirit of god they are the sons of god</string>
  <string>
 for ye have not received the spirit of bondage again to fear</string>
  <string> but ye have received the spirit of adoption whereby we cry abba father</string>
  <string>
 the spirit itself beareth witness with our spirit that we are the children of god
 if children then heirs</string>
  <string> heirs of god and joint-heirs with christ</string>
  <string> if so be that we suffer with him that we may be also glorified together</string>
  <string>
 for i reckon that the sufferings of this present time are not worthy to be compared with the glory which shall be revealed in us</string>
  <string>
 for the earnest expectation of the creature waiteth for the manifestation of the sons of god</string>
  <string>
 for the creature was made subject to vanity not willingly but by reason of him who hath subjected the same in hope
 because the creature itself also shall be delivered from the bondage of corruption into the glorious liberty of the children of god</string>
  <string>
 for we know that the whole creation groaneth and travaileth in pain together until now</string>
  <string>
 not only they but ourselves also which have the firstfruits of the spirit even we ourselves groan within ourselves waiting for the adoption to wit the redemption of our body</string>
  <string>
 for we are saved by hope but hope that is seen is not hope for what a man seeth why doth he yet hope for</string>
  <string>
 but if we hope for that we see not then do we with patience wait for it </string>
  <string>
 likewise the spirit also helpeth our infirmities for we know not what we should pray for as we ought but the spirit itself maketh intercession for us with groanings which cannot be uttered</string>
  <string>
 he that searcheth the hearts knoweth what is the mind of the spirit because he maketh intercession for the saints according to the will of god</string>
  <string>
 we know that all things work together for good to them that love god to them who are the called according to his purpose</string>
  <string>
 for whom he did foreknow he also did predestinate to be conformed to the image of his son that he might be the firstborn among many brethren</string>
  <string>
 moreover whom he did predestinate them he also called and whom he called them he also justified and whom he justified them he also glorified</string>
  <string>
 what shall we then say to these things</string>
  <string> if god be for us who can be against us</string>
  <string>
 he that spared not his own son but delivered him up for us all how shall he not with him also freely give us all things</string>
  <string>
 who shall lay any thing to the charge of god's elect</string>
  <string> it is god that justifieth</string>
  <string>
 who is he that condemneth</string>
  <string> it is christ that died yea rather that is risen again who is even at the right hand of god who also maketh intercession for us</string>
  <string>
 who shall separate us from the love of christ</string>
  <string> shall tribulation or distress or persecution or famine or nakedness or peril or sword</string>
  <string>
 as it is written for thy sake we are killed all the day long</string>
  <string> we are accounted as sheep for the slaughter</string>
  <string>
 nay in all these things we are more than conquerors through him that loved us</string>
  <string>
 for i am persuaded that neither death nor life nor angels nor principalities nor powers nor things present nor things to come
 nor height nor depth nor any other creature shall be able to separate us from the love of god which is in christ jesus our lord</string>
  <string>
 
 i say the truth in christ i lie not my conscience also bearing me witness in the holy ghost
 that i have great heaviness and continual sorrow in my heart</string>
  <string>
 for i could wish that myself were accursed from christ for my brethren my kinsmen according to the flesh
 who are israelites</string>
  <string> to whom pertaineth the adoption and the glory and the covenants and the giving of the law and the service of god and the promises</string>
  <string>
 whose are the fathers and of whom as concerning the flesh christ came who is over all god blessed for ever</string>
  <string> amen</string>
  <string>
 not as though the word of god hath taken none effect</string>
  <string> for they are not all israel which are of israel
 neither because they are the seed of abraham are they all children but in isaac shall thy seed be called</string>
  <string>
 that is they which are the children of the flesh these are not the children of god but the children of the promise are counted for the seed</string>
  <string>
 for this is the word of promise at this time will i come and sara shall have a son</string>
  <string>
 not only this </string>
  <string> but when rebecca also had conceived by one even by our father isaac</string>
  <string>
 for the children being not yet born neither having done any good or evil that the purpose of god according to election might stand not of works but of him that calleth</string>
  <string>
 it was said unto her the elder shall serve the younger</string>
  <string>
 as it is written jacob have i loved but esau have i hated</string>
  <string>
 what shall we say then</string>
  <string> is there unrighteousness with god</string>
  <string> god forbid</string>
  <string>
 for he saith to moses i will have mercy on whom i will have mercy and i will have compassion on whom i will have compassion</string>
  <string>
 so then it is not of him that willeth nor of him that runneth but of god that sheweth mercy</string>
  <string>
 for the scripture saith unto pharaoh even for this same purpose have i raised thee up that i might shew my power in thee and that my name might be declared throughout all the earth</string>
  <string>
 therefore hath he mercy on whom he will have mercy and whom he will he hardeneth</string>
  <string>
 thou wilt say then unto me why doth he yet find fault</string>
  <string> for who hath resisted his will</string>
  <string>
 nay but o man who art thou that repliest against god</string>
  <string> shall the thing formed say to him that formed it why hast thou made me thus</string>
  <string>
 hath not the potter power over the clay of the same lump to make one vessel unto honour and another unto dishonour</string>
  <string>
 what if god willing to shew his wrath and to make his power known endured with much longsuffering the vessels of wrath fitted to destruction
 that he might make known the riches of his glory on the vessels of mercy which he had afore prepared unto glory
 even us whom he hath called not of the jews only but also of the gentiles</string>
  <string>
 as he saith also in osee i will call them my people which were not my people</string>
  <string> and her beloved which was not beloved</string>
  <string>
 it shall come to pass that in the place where it was said unto them ye are not my people</string>
  <string> there shall they be called the children of the living god</string>
  <string>
 esaias also crieth concerning israel though the number of the children of israel be as the sand of the sea a remnant shall be saved
 for he will finish the work and cut it short in righteousness because a short work will the lord make upon the earth</string>
  <string>
 as esaias said before except the lord of sabaoth had left us a seed we had been as sodoma and been made like unto gomorrha</string>
  <string>
 what shall we say then</string>
  <string> that the gentiles which followed not after righteousness have attained to righteousness even the righteousness which is of faith</string>
  <string>
 but israel which followed after the law of righteousness hath not attained to the law of righteousness</string>
  <string>
 wherefore</string>
  <string> because they sought it not by faith but as it were by the works of the law</string>
  <string> for they stumbled at that stumblingstone</string>
  <string>
 as it is written behold i lay in sion a stumblingstone and rock of offence and whosoever believeth on him shall not be ashamed</string>
  <string>
 
 brethren my heart's desire and prayer to god for israel is that they might be saved</string>
  <string>
 for i bear them record that they have a zeal of god but not according to knowledge</string>
  <string>
 for they being ignorant of god's righteousness and going about to establish their own righteousness have not submitted themselves unto the righteousness of god</string>
  <string>
 for christ is the end of the law for righteousness to every one that believeth</string>
  <string>
 for moses describeth the righteousness which is of the law that the man which doeth those things shall live by them</string>
  <string>
 but the righteousness which is of faith speaketh on this wise say not in thine heart who shall ascend into heaven</string>
  <string> that is to bring christ down from above 
 or who shall descend into the deep</string>
  <string> that is to bring up christ again from the dead</string>
  <string>
 but what saith it</string>
  <string> the word is nigh thee even in thy mouth and in thy heart that is the word of faith which we preach</string>
  <string>
 that if thou shalt confess with thy mouth the lord jesus and shalt believe in thine heart that god hath raised him from the dead thou shalt be saved</string>
  <string>
 for with the heart man believeth unto righteousness</string>
  <string> and with the mouth confession is made unto salvation</string>
  <string>
 for the scripture saith whosoever believeth on him shall not be ashamed</string>
  <string>
 for there is no difference between the jew and the greek for the same lord over all is rich unto all that call upon him</string>
  <string>
 for whosoever shall call upon the name of the lord shall be saved</string>
  <string>
 how then shall they call on him in whom they have not believed</string>
  <string> and how shall they believe in him of whom they have not heard</string>
  <string> and how shall they hear without a preacher</string>
  <string>
 how shall they preach except they be sent</string>
  <string> as it is written how beautiful are the feet of them that preach the gospel of peace and bring glad tidings of good things</string>
  <string>
 but they have not all obeyed the gospel</string>
  <string> for esaias saith lord who hath believed our report</string>
  <string>
 so then faith cometh by hearing and hearing by the word of god</string>
  <string>
 but i say have they not heard</string>
  <string> yes verily their sound went into all the earth and their words unto the ends of the world</string>
  <string>
 but i say did not israel know</string>
  <string> first moses saith i will provoke you to jealousy by them that are no people and by a foolish nation i will anger you</string>
  <string>
 but esaias is very bold and saith i was found of them that sought me not</string>
  <string> i was made manifest unto them that asked not after me</string>
  <string>
 but to israel he saith all day long i have stretched forth my hands unto a disobedient and gainsaying people</string>
  <string>
 
 i say then hath god cast away his people</string>
  <string> god forbid</string>
  <string> for i also am an israelite of the seed of abraham of the tribe of benjamin</string>
  <string>
 god hath not cast away his people which he foreknew</string>
  <string> wot ye not what the scripture saith of elias</string>
  <string> how he maketh intercession to god against israel saying
 lord they have killed thy prophets and digged down thine altars</string>
  <string> and i am left alone and they seek my life</string>
  <string>
 but what saith the answer of god unto him</string>
  <string> i have reserved to myself seven thousand men who have not bowed the knee to the image of baal</string>
  <string>
 even so then at this present time also there is a remnant according to the election of grace</string>
  <string>
 if by grace then is it no more of works otherwise grace is no more grace</string>
  <string> but if it be of works then is it no more grace otherwise work is no more work</string>
  <string>
 what then</string>
  <string> israel hath not obtained that which he seeketh for</string>
  <string> but the election hath obtained it and the rest were blinded
 according as it is written god hath given them the spirit of slumber eyes that they should not see and ears that they should not hear</string>
  <string> unto this day</string>
  <string>
 david saith let their table be made a snare and a trap and a stumblingblock and a recompence unto them
 let their eyes be darkened that they may not see and bow down their back alway</string>
  <string>
 i say then have they stumbled that they should fall</string>
  <string> god forbid but rather through their fall salvation is come unto the gentiles for to provoke them to jealousy</string>
  <string>
 now if the fall of them be the riches of the world and the diminishing of them the riches of the gentiles</string>
  <string> how much more their fulness</string>
  <string>
 for i speak to you gentiles inasmuch as i am the apostle of the gentiles i magnify mine office
 if by any means i may provoke to emulation them which are my flesh and might save some of them</string>
  <string>
 for if the casting away of them be the reconciling of the world what shall the receiving of them be but life from the dead</string>
  <string>
 for if the firstfruit be holy the lump is also holy  and if the root be holy so are the branches</string>
  <string>
 if some of the branches be broken off and thou being a wild olive tree wert graffed in among them and with them partakest of the root and fatness of the olive tree</string>
  <string>
 boast not against the branches</string>
  <string> but if thou boast thou bearest not the root but the root thee</string>
  <string>
 thou wilt say then the branches were broken off that i might be graffed in</string>
  <string>
 well</string>
  <string> because of unbelief they were broken off and thou standest by faith</string>
  <string> be not highminded but fear
 for if god spared not the natural branches take heed lest he also spare not thee</string>
  <string>
 behold therefore the goodness and severity of god on them which fell severity</string>
  <string> but toward thee goodness if thou continue in his goodness otherwise thou also shalt be cut off</string>
  <string>
 they also if they abide not still in unbelief shall be graffed in for god is able to graff them in again</string>
  <string>
 for if thou wert cut out of the olive tree which is wild by nature and wert graffed contrary to nature into a good olive tree how much more shall these which be the natural branches be graffed into their own olive tree</string>
  <string>
 for i would not brethren that ye should be ignorant of this mystery lest ye should be wise in your own conceits</string>
  <string> that blindness in part is happened to israel until the fulness of the gentiles be come in</string>
  <string>
 so all israel shall be saved as it is written there shall come out of sion the deliverer and shall turn away ungodliness from jacob
 for this is my covenant unto them when i shall take away their sins</string>
  <string>
 as concerning the gospel they are enemies for your sakes but as touching the election they are beloved for the fathers' sakes</string>
  <string>
 for the gifts and calling of god are without repentance</string>
  <string>
 for as ye in times past have not believed god yet have now obtained mercy through their unbelief
 even so have these also now not believed that through your mercy they also may obtain mercy</string>
  <string>
 for god hath concluded them all in unbelief that he might have mercy upon all</string>
  <string>
 o the depth of the riches both of the wisdom and knowledge of god</string>
  <string> how unsearchable are his judgments and his ways past finding out</string>
  <string>
 for who hath known the mind of the lord</string>
  <string> or who hath been his counsellor</string>
  <string>
 or who hath first given to him and it shall be recompensed unto him again</string>
  <string>
 for of him and through him and to him are all things to whom be glory for ever</string>
  <string> amen</string>
  <string>
 
 i beseech you therefore brethren by the mercies of god that ye present your bodies a living sacrifice holy acceptable unto god which is your reasonable service</string>
  <string>
 be not conformed to this world but be ye transformed by the renewing of your mind that ye may prove what is that good and acceptable and perfect will of god</string>
  <string>
 for i say through the grace given unto me to every man that is among you not to think of himself more highly than he ought to think</string>
  <string> but to think soberly according as god hath dealt to every man the measure of faith</string>
  <string>
 for as we have many members in one body and all members have not the same office
 so we being many are one body in christ and every one members one of another</string>
  <string>
 having then gifts differing according to the grace that is given to us whether prophecy let us prophesy according to the proportion of faith</string>
  <string>
 or ministry let us wait on our ministering or he that teacheth on teaching</string>
  <string>
 or he that exhorteth on exhortation he that giveth let him do it with simplicity</string>
  <string> he that ruleth with diligence</string>
  <string> he that sheweth mercy with cheerfulness</string>
  <string>
 let love be without dissimulation</string>
  <string> abhor that which is evil</string>
  <string> cleave to that which is good</string>
  <string>
 be kindly affectioned one to another with brotherly love</string>
  <string> in honour preferring one another</string>
  <string>
 not slothful in business</string>
  <string> fervent in spirit</string>
  <string> serving the lord</string>
  <string>
 rejoicing in hope</string>
  <string> patient in tribulation</string>
  <string> continuing instant in prayer</string>
  <string>
 distributing to the necessity of saints</string>
  <string> given to hospitality</string>
  <string>
 bless them which persecute you bless and curse not</string>
  <string>
 rejoice with them that do rejoice and weep with them that weep</string>
  <string>
 be of the same mind one toward another</string>
  <string> mind not high things but condescend to men of low estate</string>
  <string> be not wise in your own conceits</string>
  <string>
 recompense to no man evil for evil</string>
  <string> provide things honest in the sight of all men</string>
  <string>
 if it be possible as much as lieth in you live peaceably with all men</string>
  <string>
 dearly beloved avenge not yourselves but rather give place unto wrath for it is written vengeance is mine</string>
  <string> i will repay saith the lord</string>
  <string>
 therefore if thine enemy hunger feed him</string>
  <string> if he thirst give him drink for in so doing thou shalt heap coals of fire on his head</string>
  <string>
 be not overcome of evil but overcome evil with good</string>
  <string>
 
 let every soul be subject unto the higher powers</string>
  <string> for there is no power but of god the powers that be are ordained of god</string>
  <string>
 whosoever therefore resisteth the power resisteth the ordinance of god and they that resist shall receive to themselves damnation</string>
  <string>
 for rulers are not a terror to good works but to the evil</string>
  <string> wilt thou then not be afraid of the power</string>
  <string> do that which is good and thou shalt have praise of the same
 for he is the minister of god to thee for good</string>
  <string> but if thou do that which is evil be afraid</string>
  <string> for he beareth not the sword in vain for he is the minister of god a revenger to execute wrath upon him that doeth evil</string>
  <string>
 wherefore ye must needs be subject not only for wrath but also for conscience sake</string>
  <string>
 for for this cause pay ye tribute also for they are god's ministers attending continually upon this very thing</string>
  <string>
 render therefore to all their dues tribute to whom tribute is due </string>
  <string> custom to whom custom</string>
  <string> fear to whom fear</string>
  <string> honour to whom honour</string>
  <string>
 owe no man any thing but to love one another for he that loveth another hath fulfilled the law</string>
  <string>
 for this thou shalt not commit adultery thou shalt not kill thou shalt not steal thou shalt not bear false witness thou shalt not covet</string>
  <string> and if there be any other commandment it is briefly comprehended in this saying namely thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself</string>
  <string>
 love worketh no ill to his neighbour therefore love is the fulfilling of the law</string>
  <string>
 that knowing the time that now it is high time to awake out of sleep for now is our salvation nearer than when we believed</string>
  <string>
 the night is far spent the day is at hand let us therefore cast off the works of darkness and let us put on the armour of light</string>
  <string>
 let us walk honestly as in the day</string>
  <string> not in rioting and drunkenness not in chambering and wantonness not in strife and envying</string>
  <string>
 but put ye on the lord jesus christ and make not provision for the flesh to fulfil the lusts thereof </string>
  <string>
 
 him that is weak in the faith receive ye but not to doubtful disputations</string>
  <string>
 for one believeth that he may eat all things another who is weak eateth herbs</string>
  <string>
 let not him that eateth despise him that eateth not</string>
  <string> and let not him which eateth not judge him that eateth for god hath received him</string>
  <string>
 who art thou that judgest another man's servant</string>
  <string> to his own master he standeth or falleth</string>
  <string> yea he shall be holden up for god is able to make him stand</string>
  <string>
 one man esteemeth one day above another another esteemeth every day alike </string>
  <string> let every man be fully persuaded in his own mind</string>
  <string>
 he that regardeth the day regardeth it unto the lord</string>
  <string> and he that regardeth not the day to the lord he doth not regard it </string>
  <string> he that eateth eateth to the lord for he giveth god thanks</string>
  <string> and he that eateth not to the lord he eateth not and giveth god thanks</string>
  <string>
 for none of us liveth to himself and no man dieth to himself</string>
  <string>
 for whether we live we live unto the lord</string>
  <string> and whether we die we die unto the lord whether we live therefore or die we are the lord's</string>
  <string>
 for to this end christ both died and rose and revived that he might be lord both of the dead and living</string>
  <string>
 but why dost thou judge thy brother</string>
  <string> or why dost thou set at nought thy brother</string>
  <string> for we shall all stand before the judgment seat of christ</string>
  <string>
 for it is written as i live saith the lord every knee shall bow to me and every tongue shall confess to god</string>
  <string>
 so then every one of us shall give account of himself to god</string>
  <string>
 let us not therefore judge one another any more but judge this rather that no man put a stumblingblock or an occasion to fall in his brother's way</string>
  <string>
 i know and am persuaded by the lord jesus that there is nothing unclean of itself but to him that esteemeth any thing to be unclean to him it is unclean</string>
  <string>
 but if thy brother be grieved with thy meat now walkest thou not charitably</string>
  <string> destroy not him with thy meat for whom christ died</string>
  <string>
 let not then your good be evil spoken of
 for the kingdom of god is not meat and drink</string>
  <string> but righteousness and peace and joy in the holy ghost</string>
  <string>
 for he that in these things serveth christ is acceptable to god and approved of men</string>
  <string>
 let us therefore follow after the things which make for peace and things wherewith one may edify another</string>
  <string>
 for meat destroy not the work of god</string>
  <string> all things indeed are pure</string>
  <string> but it is evil for that man who eateth with offence</string>
  <string>
 it is good neither to eat flesh nor to drink wine nor any thing whereby thy brother stumbleth or is offended or is made weak</string>
  <string>
 hast thou faith</string>
  <string> have it to thyself before god</string>
  <string> happy is he that condemneth not himself in that thing which he alloweth</string>
  <string>
 he that doubteth is damned if he eat because he eateth not of faith for whatsoever is not of faith is sin</string>
  <string>
 
 we then that are strong ought to bear the infirmities of the weak and not to please ourselves</string>
  <string>
 let every one of us please his neighbour for his good to edification</string>
  <string>
 for even christ pleased not himself</string>
  <string> but as it is written the reproaches of them that reproached thee fell on me</string>
  <string>
 for whatsoever things were written aforetime were written for our learning that we through patience and comfort of the scriptures might have hope</string>
  <string>
 now the god of patience and consolation grant you to be likeminded one toward another according to christ jesus
 that ye may with one mind and one mouth glorify god even the father of our lord jesus christ</string>
  <string>
 wherefore receive ye one another as christ also received us to the glory of god</string>
  <string>
 now i say that jesus christ was a minister of the circumcision for the truth of god to confirm the promises made unto the fathers
 that the gentiles might glorify god for his mercy</string>
  <string> as it is written for this cause i will confess to thee among the gentiles and sing unto thy name</string>
  <string>
 again he saith rejoice ye gentiles with his people</string>
  <string>
 again praise the lord all ye gentiles</string>
  <string> and laud him all ye people</string>
  <string>
 again esaias saith there shall be a root of jesse and he that shall rise to reign over the gentiles</string>
  <string> in him shall the gentiles trust</string>
  <string>
 now the god of hope fill you with all joy and peace in believing that ye may abound in hope through the power of the holy ghost</string>
  <string>
 i myself also am persuaded of you my brethren that ye also are full of goodness filled with all knowledge able also to admonish one another</string>
  <string>
 nevertheless brethren i have written the more boldly unto you in some sort as putting you in mind because of the grace that is given to me of god
 that i should be the minister of jesus christ to the gentiles ministering the gospel of god that the offering up of the gentiles might be acceptable being sanctified by the holy ghost</string>
  <string>
 i have therefore whereof i may glory through jesus christ in those things which pertain to god</string>
  <string>
 for i will not dare to speak of any of those things which christ hath not wrought by me to make the gentiles obedient by word and deed
 through mighty signs and wonders by the power of the spirit of god</string>
  <string> so that from jerusalem and round about unto illyricum i have fully preached the gospel of christ</string>
  <string>
 yea so have i strived to preach the gospel not where christ was named lest i should build upon another man's foundation
 but as it is written to whom he was not spoken of they shall see and they that have not heard shall understand</string>
  <string>
 for which cause also i have been much hindered from coming to you</string>
  <string>
 but now having no more place in these parts and having a great desire these many years to come unto you</string>
  <string>
 whensoever i take my journey into spain i will come to you for i trust to see you in my journey and to be brought on my way thitherward by you if first i be somewhat filled with your company </string>
  <string>
 but now i go unto jerusalem to minister unto the saints</string>
  <string>
 for it hath pleased them of macedonia and achaia to make a certain contribution for the poor saints which are at jerusalem</string>
  <string>
 it hath pleased them verily</string>
  <string> and their debtors they are</string>
  <string> for if the gentiles have been made partakers of their spiritual things their duty is also to minister unto them in carnal things</string>
  <string>
 when therefore i have performed this and have sealed to them this fruit i will come by you into spain</string>
  <string>
 i am sure that when i come unto you i shall come in the fulness of the blessing of the gospel of christ</string>
  <string>
 now i beseech you brethren for the lord jesus christ's sake and for the love of the spirit that ye strive together with me in your prayers to god for me</string>
  <string>
 that i may be delivered from them that do not believe in judaea</string>
  <string> and that my service which i have for jerusalem may be accepted of the saints</string>
  <string>
 that i may come unto you with joy by the will of god and may with you be refreshed</string>
  <string>
 now the god of peace be with you all</string>
  <string> amen</string>
  <string>
 
 i commend unto you phebe our sister which is a servant of the church which is at cenchrea
 that ye receive her in the lord as becometh saints and that ye assist her in whatsoever business she hath need of you for she hath been a succourer of many and of myself also</string>
  <string>
 greet priscilla and aquila my helpers in christ jesus

 salute asyncritus phlegon hermas patrobas hermes and the brethren which are with them</string>
  <string>
 salute philologus and julia nereus and his sister and olympas and all the saints which are with them</string>
  <string>
 salute one another with an holy kiss</string>
  <string> the churches of christ salute you</string>
  <string>
 now i beseech you brethren mark them which cause divisions and offences contrary to the doctrine which ye have learned</string>
  <string> and avoid them</string>
  <string>
 for they that are such serve not our lord jesus christ but their own belly</string>
  <string> and by good words and fair speeches deceive the hearts of the simple</string>
  <string>
 for your obedience is come abroad unto all men </string>
  <string> i am glad therefore on your behalf but yet i would have you wise unto that which is good and simple concerning evil</string>
  <string>
 the god of peace shall bruise satan under your feet shortly</string>
  <string> the grace of our lord jesus christ be with you</string>
  <string> amen</string>
  <string>
 timotheus my workfellow and lucius and jason and sosipater my kinsmen salute you</string>
  <string>

  <string>
 gaius mine host and of the whole church saluteth you</string>
  <string> erastus the chamberlain of the city saluteth you and quartus a brother</string>
  <string>
 the grace of our lord jesus christ be with you all</string>
  <string> amen</string>
  <string>
 now to him that is of power to stablish you according to my gospel and the preaching of jesus christ according to the revelation of the mystery which was kept secret since the world began
 but now is made manifest and by the scriptures of the prophets according to the commandment of the everlasting god made known to all nations for the obedience of faith
 to god only wise be glory through jesus christ for ever</string>
  <string> amen</string>
  <string>
 written to the romans from corinthus and sent by phebe servant of the church at cenchrea</string>
  <string>
 the first epistle of paul the apostle to the corinthians
 
 paul called to be an apostle of jesus christ through the will of god and sosthenes our brother
 unto the church of god which is at corinth to them that are sanctified in christ jesus called to be saints with all that in every place call upon the name of jesus christ our lord both their's and our's
 grace be unto you and peace from god our father and from the lord jesus christ</string>
  <string>
 i thank my god always on your behalf for the grace of god which is given you by jesus christ</string>
  <string>
 that in every thing ye are enriched by him in all utterance and in all knowledge</string>
  <string>
 even as the testimony of christ was confirmed in you
 so that ye come behind in no gift</string>
  <string> waiting for the coming of our lord jesus christ
 who shall also confirm you unto the end that ye may be blameless in the day of our lord jesus christ</string>
  <string>
 god is faithful by whom ye were called unto the fellowship of his son jesus christ our lord</string>
  <string>
 now i beseech you brethren by the name of our lord jesus christ that ye all speak the same thing and that there be no divisions among you</string>
  <string> but that ye be perfectly joined together in the same mind and in the same judgment</string>
  <string>
 for it hath been declared unto me of you my brethren by them which are of the house of chloe that there are contentions among you</string>
  <string>
 now this i say that every one of you saith i am of paul</string>
  <string> and i of apollos</string>
  <string> and i of cephas</string>
  <string> and i of christ</string>
  <string>
 is christ divided</string>
  <string> was paul crucified for you</string>
  <string> or were ye baptized in the name of paul</string>
  <string>
 i thank god that i baptized none of you but crispus and gaius</string>
  <string>
 lest any should say that i had baptized in mine own name</string>
  <string>
 i baptized also the household of stephanas besides i know not whether i baptized any other</string>
  <string>
 for christ sent me not to baptize but to preach the gospel not with wisdom of words lest the cross of christ should be made of none effect</string>
  <string>
 for the preaching of the cross is to them that perish foolishness</string>
  <string> but unto us which are saved it is the power of god</string>
  <string>
 for it is written i will destroy the wisdom of the wise and will bring to nothing the understanding of the prudent</string>
  <string>
 where is the wise</string>
  <string> where is the scribe</string>
  <string> where is the disputer of this world</string>
  <string> hath not god made foolish the wisdom of this world</string>
  <string>
 for after that in the wisdom of god the world by wisdom knew not god it pleased god by the foolishness of preaching to save them that believe</string>
  <string>
 for the jews require a sign and the greeks seek after wisdom
 but we preach christ crucified unto the jews a stumblingblock and unto the greeks foolishness</string>
  <string>
 but unto them which are called both jews and greeks christ the power of god and the wisdom of god</string>
  <string>
 because the foolishness of god is wiser than men</string>
  <string> and the weakness of god is stronger than men</string>
  <string>
 for ye see your calling brethren how that not many wise men after the flesh not many mighty not many noble are called 
 but god hath chosen the foolish things of the world to confound the wise</string>
  <string> and god hath chosen the weak things of the world to confound the things which are mighty</string>
  <string>
 base things of the world and things which are despised hath god chosen yea and things which are not to bring to nought things that are
 that no flesh should glory in his presence</string>
  <string>
 but of him are ye in christ jesus who of god is made unto us wisdom and righteousness and sanctification and redemption
 that according as it is written he that glorieth let him glory in the lord</string>
  <string>
 
 i brethren when i came to you came not with excellency of speech or of wisdom declaring unto you the testimony of god</string>
  <string>
 for i determined not to know any thing among you save jesus christ and him crucified</string>
  <string>
 i was with you in weakness and in fear and in much trembling</string>
  <string>
 my speech and my preaching was not with enticing words of man's wisdom but in demonstration of the spirit and of power
 that your faith should not stand in the wisdom of men but in the power of god</string>
  <string>
 howbeit we speak wisdom among them that are perfect yet not the wisdom of this world nor of the princes of this world that come to nought
 but we speak the wisdom of god in a mystery even the hidden wisdom which god ordained before the world unto our glory
 which none of the princes of this world knew for had they known it they would not have crucified the lord of glory</string>
  <string>
 but as it is written eye hath not seen nor ear heard neither have entered into the heart of man the things which god hath prepared for them that love him</string>
  <string>
 but god hath revealed them unto us by his spirit for the spirit searcheth all things yea the deep things of god</string>
  <string>
 for what man knoweth the things of a man save the spirit of man which is in him</string>
  <string> even so the things of god knoweth no man but the spirit of god</string>
  <string>
 now we have received not the spirit of the world but the spirit which is of god</string>
  <string> that we might know the things that are freely given to us of god</string>
  <string>
 which things also we speak not in the words which man's wisdom teacheth but which the holy ghost teacheth</string>
  <string> comparing spiritual things with spiritual</string>
  <string>
 but the natural man receiveth not the things of the spirit of god for they are foolishness unto him neither can he know them because they are spiritually discerned</string>
  <string>
 but he that is spiritual judgeth all things yet he himself is judged of no man</string>
  <string>
 for who hath known the mind of the lord that he may instruct him</string>
  <string> but we have the mind of christ</string>
  <string>
 
 i brethren could not speak unto you as unto spiritual but as unto carnal even as unto babes in christ</string>
  <string>
 i have fed you with milk and not with meat for hitherto ye were not able to bear it neither yet now are ye able</string>
  <string>
 for ye are yet carnal for whereas there is among you envying and strife and divisions are ye not carnal and walk as men</string>
  <string>
 for while one saith i am of paul</string>
  <string> and another i am of apollos</string>
  <string> are ye not carnal</string>
  <string>
 who then is paul and who is apollos but ministers by whom ye believed even as the lord gave to every man</string>
  <string>
 i have planted apollos watered</string>
  <string> but god gave the increase</string>
  <string>
 so then neither is he that planteth any thing neither he that watereth</string>
  <string> but god that giveth the increase</string>
  <string>
 now he that planteth and he that watereth are one and every man shall receive his own reward according to his own labour</string>
  <string>
 for we are labourers together with god ye are god's husbandry ye are god's building</string>
  <string>
 according to the grace of god which is given unto me as a wise masterbuilder i have laid the foundation and another buildeth thereon</string>
  <string> but let every man take heed how he buildeth thereupon</string>
  <string>
 for other foundation can no man lay than that is laid which is jesus christ</string>
  <string>
 now if any man build upon this foundation gold silver precious stones wood hay stubble</string>
  <string>
 every man's work shall be made manifest for the day shall declare it because it shall be revealed by fire</string>
  <string> and the fire shall try every man's work of what sort it is</string>
  <string>
 if any man's work abide which he hath built thereupon he shall receive a reward</string>
  <string>
 if any man's work shall be burned he shall suffer loss but he himself shall be saved</string>
  <string> yet so as by fire</string>
  <string>
 know ye not that ye are the temple of god and that the spirit of god dwelleth in you</string>
  <string>
 if any man defile the temple of god him shall god destroy</string>
  <string> for the temple of god is holy which temple ye are</string>
  <string>
 let no man deceive himself</string>
  <string> if any man among you seemeth to be wise in this world let him become a fool that he may be wise</string>
  <string>
 for the wisdom of this world is foolishness with god</string>
  <string> for it is written he taketh the wise in their own craftiness</string>
  <string>
 again the lord knoweth the thoughts of the wise that they are vain</string>
  <string>
 therefore let no man glory in men</string>
  <string> for all things are your's</string>
  <string>
 whether paul or apollos or cephas or the world or life or death or things present or things to come</string>
  <string> all are your's</string>
  <string>
 ye are christ's</string>
  <string> and christ is god's</string>
  <string>
 
 let a man so account of us as of the ministers of christ and stewards of the mysteries of god</string>
  <string>
 moreover it is required in stewards that a man be found faithful</string>
  <string>
 but with me it is a very small thing that i should be judged of you or of man's judgment yea i judge not mine own self</string>
  <string>
 for i know nothing by myself</string>
  <string> yet am i not hereby justified but he that judgeth me is the lord</string>
  <string>
 therefore judge nothing before the time until the lord come who both will bring to light the hidden things of darkness and will make manifest the counsels of the hearts and then shall every man have praise of god</string>
  <string>
 these things brethren i have in a figure transferred to myself and to apollos for your sakes</string>
  <string> that ye might learn in us not to think of men above that which is written that no one of you be puffed up for one against another</string>
  <string>
 for who maketh thee to differ from another </string>
  <string> and what hast thou that thou didst not receive</string>
  <string> now if thou didst receive it why dost thou glory as if thou hadst not received it </string>
  <string>
 now ye are full now ye are rich ye have reigned as kings without us and i would to god ye did reign that we also might reign with you</string>
  <string>
 for i think that god hath set forth us the apostles last as it were appointed to death for we are made a spectacle unto the world and to angels and to men</string>
  <string>
 we are fools for christ's sake but ye are wise in christ</string>
  <string> we are weak but ye are strong</string>
  <string> ye are honourable but we are despised</string>
  <string>
 even unto this present hour we both hunger and thirst and are naked and are buffeted and have no certain dwellingplace</string>
  <string>
 labour working with our own hands being reviled we bless</string>
  <string> being persecuted we suffer it
 being defamed we intreat we are made as the filth of the world and are the offscouring of all things unto this day</string>
  <string>
 i write not these things to shame you but as my beloved sons i warn you </string>
  <string>
 for though ye have ten thousand instructors in christ yet have ye not many fathers for in christ jesus i have begotten you through the gospel</string>
  <string>
 wherefore i beseech you be ye followers of me</string>
  <string>
 for this cause have i sent unto you timotheus who is my beloved son and faithful in the lord who shall bring you into remembrance of my ways which be in christ as i teach every where in every church</string>
  <string>
 now some are puffed up as though i would not come to you</string>
  <string>
 but i will come to you shortly if the lord will and will know not the speech of them which are puffed up but the power</string>
  <string>
 for the kingdom of god is not in word but in power</string>
  <string>
 what will ye</string>
  <string> shall i come unto you with a rod or in love and in the spirit of meekness</string>
  <string>
 
 it is reported commonly that there is fornication among you and such fornication as is not so much as named among the gentiles that one should have his father's wife</string>
  <string>
 ye are puffed up and have not rather mourned that he that hath done this deed might be taken away from among you</string>
  <string>
 for i verily as absent in body but present in spirit have judged already as though i were present concerning him that hath so done this deed
 in the name of our lord jesus christ when ye are gathered together and my spirit with the power of our lord jesus christ
 to deliver such an one unto satan for the destruction of the flesh that the spirit may be saved in the day of the lord jesus</string>
  <string>
 your glorying is not good</string>
  <string> know ye not that a little leaven leaveneth the whole lump</string>
  <string>
 purge out therefore the old leaven that ye may be a new lump as ye are unleavened</string>
  <string> for even christ our passover is sacrificed for us
 therefore let us keep the feast not with old leaven neither with the leaven of malice and wickedness</string>
  <string> but with the unleavened bread of sincerity and truth</string>
  <string>
 i wrote unto you in an epistle not to company with fornicators
 yet not altogether with the fornicators of this world or with the covetous or extortioners or with idolaters</string>
  <string> for then must ye needs go out of the world</string>
  <string>
 but now i have written unto you not to keep company if any man that is called a brother be a fornicator or covetous or an idolater or a railer or a drunkard or an extortioner</string>
  <string> with such an one no not to eat</string>
  <string>
 for what have i to do to judge them also that are without</string>
  <string> do not ye judge them that are within</string>
  <string>
 but them that are without god judgeth</string>
  <string> therefore put away from among yourselves that wicked person</string>
  <string>
 
 dare any of you having a matter against another go to law before the unjust and not before the saints</string>
  <string>
 do ye not know that the saints shall judge the world</string>
  <string> and if the world shall be judged by you are ye unworthy to judge the smallest matters</string>
  <string>
 know ye not that we shall judge angels</string>
  <string> how much more things that pertain to this life</string>
  <string>
 if then ye have judgments of things pertaining to this life set them to judge who are least esteemed in the church</string>
  <string>
 i speak to your shame</string>
  <string> is it so that there is not a wise man among you</string>
  <string> no not one that shall be able to judge between his brethren</string>
  <string>
 but brother goeth to law with brother and that before the unbelievers</string>
  <string>
 now therefore there is utterly a fault among you because ye go to law one with another</string>
  <string> why do ye not rather take wrong</string>
  <string> why do ye not rather suffer yourselves to be defrauded</string>
  <string>
 nay ye do wrong and defraud and that your brethren</string>
  <string>
 know ye not that the unrighteous shall not inherit the kingdom of god</string>
  <string> be not deceived neither fornicators nor idolaters nor adulterers nor effeminate nor abusers of themselves with mankind
 nor thieves nor covetous nor drunkards nor revilers nor extortioners shall inherit the kingdom of god</string>
  <string>
 such were some of you but ye are washed but ye are sanctified but ye are justified in the name of the lord jesus and by the spirit of our god</string>
  <string>
 all things are lawful unto me but all things are not expedient all things are lawful for me but i will not be brought under the power of any</string>
  <string>
 meats for the belly and the belly for meats but god shall destroy both it and them</string>
  <string> now the body is not for fornication but for the lord</string>
  <string> and the lord for the body</string>
  <string>
 god hath both raised up the lord and will also raise up us by his own power</string>
  <string>
 know ye not that your bodies are the members of christ</string>
  <string> shall i then take the members of christ and make them the members of an harlot</string>
  <string> god forbid</string>
  <string>
 what</string>
  <string> know ye not that he which is joined to an harlot is one body</string>
  <string> for two saith he shall be one flesh</string>
  <string>
 but he that is joined unto the lord is one spirit</string>
  <string>
 flee fornication</string>
  <string> every sin that a man doeth is without the body</string>
  <string> but he that committeth fornication sinneth against his own body</string>
  <string>
 what</string>
  <string> know ye not that your body is the temple of the holy ghost which is in you which ye have of god and ye are not your own</string>
  <string>
 for ye are bought with a price therefore glorify god in your body and in your spirit which are god's</string>
  <string>
 
 now concerning the things whereof ye wrote unto me it is good for a man not to touch a woman</string>
  <string>
 nevertheless to avoid fornication let every man have his own wife and let every woman have her own husband</string>
  <string>
 let the husband render unto the wife due benevolence and likewise also the wife unto the husband</string>
  <string>
 the wife hath not power of her own body but the husband and likewise also the husband hath not power of his own body but the wife</string>
  <string>
 defraud ye not one the other except it be with consent for a time that ye may give yourselves to fasting and prayer</string>
  <string> and come together again that satan tempt you not for your incontinency</string>
  <string>
 but i speak this by permission and not of commandment</string>
  <string>
 for i would that all men were even as i myself</string>
  <string> but every man hath his proper gift of god one after this manner and another after that</string>
  <string>
 i say therefore to the unmarried and widows it is good for them if they abide even as i</string>
  <string>
 but if they cannot contain let them marry for it is better to marry than to burn</string>
  <string>
 unto the married i command yet not i but the lord let not the wife depart from her husband
 but and if she depart let her remain unmarried or be reconciled to her husband and let not the husband put away his wife</string>
  <string>
 but to the rest speak i not the lord if any brother hath a wife that believeth not and she be pleased to dwell with him let him not put her away</string>
  <string>
 the woman which hath an husband that believeth not and if he be pleased to dwell with her let her not leave him</string>
  <string>
 for the unbelieving husband is sanctified by the wife and the unbelieving wife is sanctified by the husband else were your children unclean</string>
  <string> but now are they holy</string>
  <string>
 but if the unbelieving depart let him depart</string>
  <string> a brother or a sister is not under bondage in such cases  but god hath called us to peace</string>
  <string>
 for what knowest thou o wife whether thou shalt save thy husband</string>
  <string> or how knowest thou o man whether thou shalt save thy wife</string>
  <string>
 but as god hath distributed to every man as the lord hath called every one so let him walk</string>
  <string> so ordain i in all churches</string>
  <string>
 is any man called being circumcised</string>
  <string> let him not become uncircumcised</string>
  <string> is any called in uncircumcision</string>
  <string> let him not be circumcised</string>
  <string>
 circumcision is nothing and uncircumcision is nothing but the keeping of the commandments of god</string>
  <string>
 let every man abide in the same calling wherein he was called</string>
  <string>
 art thou called being a servant</string>
  <string> care not for it but if thou mayest be made free use it rather</string>
  <string>
 for he that is called in the lord being a servant is the lord's freeman likewise also he that is called being free is christ's servant</string>
  <string>
 ye are bought with a price</string>
  <string> be not ye the servants of men</string>
  <string>
 brethren let every man wherein he is called therein abide with god</string>
  <string>
 now concerning virgins i have no commandment of the lord yet i give my judgment as one that hath obtained mercy of the lord to be faithful</string>
  <string>
 i suppose therefore that this is good for the present distress i say that it is good for a man so to be</string>
  <string>
 art thou bound unto a wife</string>
  <string> seek not to be loosed</string>
  <string> art thou loosed from a wife</string>
  <string> seek not a wife</string>
  <string>
 but and if thou marry thou hast not sinned</string>
  <string> and if a virgin marry she hath not sinned</string>
  <string> nevertheless such shall have trouble in the flesh but i spare you</string>
  <string>
 but this i say brethren the time is short it remaineth that both they that have wives be as though they had none</string>
  <string>
 they that weep as though they wept not</string>
  <string> and they that rejoice as though they rejoiced not</string>
  <string> and they that buy as though they possessed not</string>
  <string>
 they that use this world as not abusing it  for the fashion of this world passeth away</string>
  <string>
 but i would have you without carefulness</string>
  <string> he that is unmarried careth for the things that belong to the lord how he may please the lord
 but he that is married careth for the things that are of the world how he may please his wife</string>
  <string>
 there is difference also between a wife and a virgin</string>
  <string> the unmarried woman careth for the things of the lord that she may be holy both in body and in spirit but she that is married careth for the things of the world how she may please her husband</string>
  <string>
 this i speak for your own profit</string>
  <string> not that i may cast a snare upon you but for that which is comely and that ye may attend upon the lord without distraction</string>
  <string>
 but if any man think that he behaveth himself uncomely toward his virgin if she pass the flower of her age and need so require let him do what he will he sinneth not let them marry</string>
  <string>
 nevertheless he that standeth stedfast in his heart having no necessity but hath power over his own will and hath so decreed in his heart that he will keep his virgin doeth well</string>
  <string>
 so then he that giveth her in marriage doeth well</string>
  <string> but he that giveth her not in marriage doeth better</string>
  <string>
 the wife is bound by the law as long as her husband liveth</string>
  <string> but if her husband be dead she is at liberty to be married to whom she will</string>
  <string> only in the lord</string>
  <string>
 but she is happier if she so abide after my judgment and i think also that i have the spirit of god</string>
  <string>
 
 now as touching things offered unto idols we know that we all have knowledge</string>
  <string> knowledge puffeth up but charity edifieth</string>
  <string>
 if any man think that he knoweth any thing he knoweth nothing yet as he ought to know</string>
  <string>
 but if any man love god the same is known of him</string>
  <string>
 as concerning therefore the eating of those things that are offered in sacrifice unto idols we know that an idol is nothing in the world and that there is none other god but one</string>
  <string>
 for though there be that are called gods whether in heaven or in earth as there be gods many and lords many
 but to us there is but one god the father of whom are all things and we in him</string>
  <string> and one lord jesus christ by whom are all things and we by him</string>
  <string>
 howbeit there is not in every man that knowledge for some with conscience of the idol unto this hour eat it as a thing offered unto an idol</string>
  <string> and their conscience being weak is defiled</string>
  <string>
 but meat commendeth us not to god for neither if we eat are we the better</string>
  <string> neither if we eat not are we the worse</string>
  <string>
 but take heed lest by any means this liberty of your's become a stumblingblock to them that are weak</string>
  <string>
 for if any man see thee which hast knowledge sit at meat in the idol's temple shall not the conscience of him which is weak be emboldened to eat those things which are offered to idols</string>
  <string>
 through thy knowledge shall the weak brother perish for whom christ died</string>
  <string>
 but when ye sin so against the brethren and wound their weak conscience ye sin against christ</string>
  <string>
 wherefore if meat make my brother to offend i will eat no flesh while the world standeth lest i make my brother to offend</string>
  <string>
 
 am i not an apostle</string>
  <string> am i not free</string>
  <string> have i not seen jesus christ our lord</string>
  <string> are not ye my work in the lord</string>
  <string>
 if i be not an apostle unto others yet doubtless i am to you for the seal of mine apostleship are ye in the lord</string>
  <string>
 mine answer to them that do examine me is this
 have we not power to eat and to drink</string>
  <string>
 have we not power to lead about a sister a wife as well as other apostles and as the brethren of the lord and cephas</string>
  <string>
 or i only and barnabas have not we power to forbear working</string>
  <string>
 who goeth a warfare any time at his own charges</string>
  <string> who planteth a vineyard and eateth not of the fruit thereof</string>
  <string> or who feedeth a flock and eateth not of the milk of the flock</string>
  <string>
 say i these things as a man</string>
  <string> or saith not the law the same also</string>
  <string>
 for it is written in the law of moses thou shalt not muzzle the mouth of the ox that treadeth out the corn</string>
  <string> doth god take care for oxen</string>
  <string>
 or saith he it altogether for our sakes</string>
  <string> for our sakes no doubt this is written that he that ploweth should plow in hope</string>
  <string> and that he that thresheth in hope should be partaker of his hope</string>
  <string>
 if we have sown unto you spiritual things is it a great thing if we shall reap your carnal things</string>
  <string>
 if others be partakers of this power over you are not we rather</string>
  <string> nevertheless we have not used this power</string>
  <string> but suffer all things lest we should hinder the gospel of christ</string>
  <string>
 do ye not know that they which minister about holy things live of the things of the temple</string>
  <string> and they which wait at the altar are partakers with the altar</string>
  <string>
 even so hath the lord ordained that they which preach the gospel should live of the gospel</string>
  <string>
 but i have used none of these things neither have i written these things that it should be so done unto me for it were better for me to die than that any man should make my glorying void</string>
  <string>
 for though i preach the gospel i have nothing to glory of for necessity is laid upon me</string>
  <string> yea woe is unto me if i preach not the gospel</string>
  <string>
 for if i do this thing willingly i have a reward but if against my will a dispensation of the gospel is committed unto me</string>
  <string>
 what is my reward then</string>
  <string> verily that when i preach the gospel i may make the gospel of christ without charge that i abuse not my power in the gospel</string>
  <string>
 for though i be free from all men yet have i made myself servant unto all that i might gain the more</string>
  <string>
 unto the jews i became as a jew that i might gain the jews</string>
  <string> to them that are under the law as under the law that i might gain them that are under the law</string>
  <string>
 to them that are without law as without law being not without law to god but under the law to christ that i might gain them that are without law</string>
  <string>
 to the weak became i as weak that i might gain the weak i am made all things to all men that i might by all means save some</string>
  <string>
 this i do for the gospel's sake that i might be partaker thereof with you </string>
  <string>
 know ye not that they which run in a race run all but one receiveth the prize</string>
  <string> so run that ye may obtain</string>
  <string>
 every man that striveth for the mastery is temperate in all things</string>
  <string> now they do it to obtain a corruptible crown</string>
  <string> but we an incorruptible</string>
  <string>
 i therefore so run not as uncertainly</string>
  <string> so fight i not as one that beateth the air
 but i keep under my body and bring it into subjection lest that by any means when i have preached to others i myself should be a castaway</string>
  <string>
 
 moreover brethren i would not that ye should be ignorant how that all our fathers were under the cloud and all passed through the sea</string>
  <string>
 were all baptized unto moses in the cloud and in the sea</string>
  <string>
 did all eat the same spiritual meat</string>
  <string>
 did all drink the same spiritual drink for they drank of that spiritual rock that followed them and that rock was christ</string>
  <string>
 but with many of them god was not well pleased for they were overthrown in the wilderness</string>
  <string>
 now these things were our examples to the intent we should not lust after evil things as they also lusted</string>
  <string>
 neither be ye idolaters as were some of them</string>
  <string> as it is written the people sat down to eat and drink and rose up to play</string>
  <string>
 neither let us commit fornication as some of them committed and fell in one day three and twenty thousand</string>
  <string>
 neither let us tempt christ as some of them also tempted and were destroyed of serpents</string>
  <string>
 neither murmur ye as some of them also murmured and were destroyed of the destroyer</string>
  <string>
 now all these things happened unto them for ensamples and they are written for our admonition upon whom the ends of the world are come</string>
  <string>
 wherefore let him that thinketh he standeth take heed lest he fall</string>
  <string>
 there hath no temptation taken you but such as is common to man but god is faithful who will not suffer you to be tempted above that ye are able</string>
  <string> but will with the temptation also make a way to escape that ye may be able to bear it </string>
  <string>
 wherefore my dearly beloved flee from idolatry</string>
  <string>
 i speak as to wise men</string>
  <string> judge ye what i say</string>
  <string>
 the cup of blessing which we bless is it not the communion of the blood of christ</string>
  <string> the bread which we break is it not the communion of the body of christ</string>
  <string>
 for we being many are one bread and one body for we are all partakers of that one bread</string>
  <string>
 behold israel after the flesh are not they which eat of the sacrifices partakers of the altar</string>
  <string>
 what say i then</string>
  <string> that the idol is any thing or that which is offered in sacrifice to idols is any thing</string>
  <string>
 but i say that the things which the gentiles sacrifice they sacrifice to devils and not to god and i would not that ye should have fellowship with devils</string>
  <string>
 ye cannot drink the cup of the lord and the cup of devils ye cannot be partakers of the lord's table and of the table of devils</string>
  <string>
 do we provoke the lord to jealousy</string>
  <string> are we stronger than he</string>
  <string>
 all things are lawful for me but all things are not expedient all things are lawful for me but all things edify not</string>
  <string>
 let no man seek his own but every man another's wealth </string>
  <string>
 whatsoever is sold in the shambles that eat asking no question for conscience sake
 for the earth is the lord's and the fulness thereof</string>
  <string>
 if any of them that believe not bid you to a feast and ye be disposed to go</string>
  <string> whatsoever is set before you eat asking no question for conscience sake</string>
  <string>
 but if any man say unto you this is offered in sacrifice unto idols eat not for his sake that shewed it and for conscience sake for the earth is the lord's and the fulness thereof
 conscience i say not thine own but of the other for why is my liberty judged of another man's conscience</string>
  <string>
 for if i by grace be a partaker why am i evil spoken of for that for which i give thanks</string>
  <string>
 whether therefore ye eat or drink or whatsoever ye do do all to the glory of god</string>
  <string>
 give none offence neither to the jews nor to the gentiles nor to the church of god
 even as i please all men in all things not seeking mine own profit but the profit of many that they may be saved</string>
  <string>
 
 be ye followers of me even as i also am of christ</string>
  <string>
 now i praise you brethren that ye remember me in all things and keep the ordinances as i delivered them to you</string>
  <string>
 but i would have you know that the head of every man is christ</string>
  <string> and the head of the woman is the man</string>
  <string> and the head of christ is god</string>
  <string>
 every man praying or prophesying having his head covered dishonoureth his head</string>
  <string>
 but every woman that prayeth or prophesieth with her head uncovered dishonoureth her head for that is even all one as if she were shaven</string>
  <string>
 for if the woman be not covered let her also be shorn but if it be a shame for a woman to be shorn or shaven let her be covered</string>
  <string>
 for a man indeed ought not to cover his head forasmuch as he is the image and glory of god but the woman is the glory of the man</string>
  <string>
 for the man is not of the woman</string>
  <string> but the woman of the man</string>
  <string>
 neither was the man created for the woman</string>
  <string> but the woman for the man</string>
  <string>
 for this cause ought the woman to have power on her head because of the angels</string>
  <string>
 nevertheless neither is the man without the woman neither the woman without the man in the lord</string>
  <string>
 for as the woman is of the man even so is the man also by the woman</string>
  <string> but all things of god</string>
  <string>
 judge in yourselves is it comely that a woman pray unto god uncovered</string>
  <string>
 doth not even nature itself teach you that if a man have long hair it is a shame unto him</string>
  <string>
 but if a woman have long hair it is a glory to her for her hair is given her for a covering</string>
  <string>
 but if any man seem to be contentious we have no such custom neither the churches of god</string>
  <string>
 now in this that i declare unto you i praise you not that ye come together not for the better but for the worse</string>
  <string>
 for first of all when ye come together in the church i hear that there be divisions among you</string>
  <string> and i partly believe it</string>
  <string>
 for there must be also heresies among you that they which are approved may be made manifest among you</string>
  <string>
 when ye come together therefore into one place this is not to eat the lord's supper</string>
  <string>
 for in eating every one taketh before other his own supper and one is hungry and another is drunken</string>
  <string>
 what</string>
  <string> have ye not houses to eat and to drink in</string>
  <string> or despise ye the church of god and shame them that have not</string>
  <string> what shall i say to you</string>
  <string> shall i praise you in this</string>
  <string> i praise you not</string>
  <string>
 for i have received of the lord that which also i delivered unto you that the lord jesus the same night in which he was betrayed took bread
 when he had given thanks he brake it and said take eat this is my body which is broken for you this do in remembrance of me</string>
  <string>
 after the same manner also he took the cup when he had supped saying this cup is the new testament in my blood this do ye as oft as ye drink it in remembrance of me</string>
  <string>
 for as often as ye eat this bread and drink this cup ye do shew the lord's death till he come</string>
  <string>
 wherefore whosoever shall eat this bread and drink this cup of the lord unworthily shall be guilty of the body and blood of the lord</string>
  <string>
 but let a man examine himself and so let him eat of that bread and drink of that cup</string>
  <string>
 for he that eateth and drinketh unworthily eateth and drinketh damnation to himself not discerning the lord's body</string>
  <string>
 for this cause many are weak and sickly among you and many sleep</string>
  <string>
 for if we would judge ourselves we should not be judged</string>
  <string>
 but when we are judged we are chastened of the lord that we should not be condemned with the world</string>
  <string>
 wherefore my brethren when ye come together to eat tarry one for another</string>
  <string>
 if any man hunger let him eat at home</string>
  <string> that ye come not together unto condemnation</string>
  <string> the rest will i set in order when i come</string>
  <string>
 
 now concerning spiritual gifts brethren i would not have you ignorant</string>
  <string>
 ye know that ye were gentiles carried away unto these dumb idols even as ye were led</string>
  <string>
 wherefore i give you to understand that no man speaking by the spirit of god calleth jesus accursed and that no man can say that jesus is the lord but by the holy ghost</string>
  <string>
 now there are diversities of gifts but the same spirit</string>
  <string>
 there are differences of administrations but the same lord</string>
  <string>
 there are diversities of operations but it is the same god which worketh all in all</string>
  <string>
 but the manifestation of the spirit is given to every man to profit withal</string>
  <string>
 for to one is given by the spirit the word of wisdom</string>
  <string> to another the word of knowledge by the same spirit</string>
  <string>
 to another faith by the same spirit</string>
  <string> to another the gifts of healing by the same spirit</string>
  <string>
 to another the working of miracles</string>
  <string> to another prophecy</string>
  <string> to another discerning of spirits</string>
  <string> to another divers kinds of tongues</string>
  <string> to another the interpretation of tongues
 but all these worketh that one and the selfsame spirit dividing to every man severally as he will</string>
  <string>
 for as the body is one and hath many members and all the members of that one body being many are one body so also is christ</string>
  <string>
 for by one spirit are we all baptized into one body whether we be jews or gentiles whether we be bond or free</string>
  <string> and have been all made to drink into one spirit</string>
  <string>
 for the body is not one member but many</string>
  <string>
 if the foot shall say because i am not the hand i am not of the body</string>
  <string> is it therefore not of the body</string>
  <string>
 if the ear shall say because i am not the eye i am not of the body</string>
  <string> is it therefore not of the body</string>
  <string>
 if the whole body were an eye where were the hearing</string>
  <string> if the whole were hearing where were the smelling</string>
  <string>
 but now hath god set the members every one of them in the body as it hath pleased him</string>
  <string>
 if they were all one member where were the body</string>
  <string>
 but now are they many members yet but one body</string>
  <string>
 the eye cannot say unto the hand i have no need of thee nor again the head to the feet i have no need of you</string>
  <string>
 nay much more those members of the body which seem to be more feeble are necessary
 those members of the body which we think to be less honourable upon these we bestow more abundant honour</string>
  <string> and our uncomely parts have more abundant comeliness</string>
  <string>
 for our comely parts have no need but god hath tempered the body together having given more abundant honour to that part which lacked
 that there should be no schism in the body</string>
  <string> but that the members should have the same care one for another</string>
  <string>
 whether one member suffer all the members suffer with it</string>
  <string> or one member be honoured all the members rejoice with it</string>
  <string>
 now ye are the body of christ and members in particular</string>
  <string>
 god hath set some in the church first apostles secondarily prophets thirdly teachers after that miracles then gifts of healings helps governments diversities of tongues</string>
  <string>
 are all apostles</string>
  <string> are all prophets</string>
  <string> are all teachers</string>
  <string> are all workers of miracles</string>
  <string>
 have all the gifts of healing</string>
  <string> do all speak with tongues</string>
  <string> do all interpret</string>
  <string>
 but covet earnestly the best gifts and yet shew i unto you a more excellent way</string>
  <string>
 
 though i speak with the tongues of men and of angels and have not charity i am become as sounding brass or a tinkling cymbal</string>
  <string>
 though i have the gift of prophecy and understand all mysteries and all knowledge</string>
  <string> and though i have all faith so that i could remove mountains and have not charity i am nothing</string>
  <string>
 though i bestow all my goods to feed the poor and though i give my body to be burned and have not charity it profiteth me nothing</string>
  <string>
 charity suffereth long and is kind</string>
  <string> charity envieth not</string>
  <string> charity vaunteth not itself is not puffed up
 doth not behave itself unseemly seeketh not her own is not easily provoked thinketh no evil</string>
  <string>
 rejoiceth not in iniquity but rejoiceth in the truth</string>
  <string>
 beareth all things believeth all things hopeth all things endureth all things</string>
  <string>
 charity never faileth but whether there be prophecies they shall fail</string>
  <string> whether there be tongues they shall cease</string>
  <string> whether there be knowledge it shall vanish away</string>
  <string>
 for we know in part and we prophesy in part</string>
  <string>
 but when that which is perfect is come then that which is in part shall be done away</string>
  <string>
 when i was a child i spake as a child i understood as a child i thought as a child but when i became a man i put away childish things</string>
  <string>
 for now we see through a glass darkly</string>
  <string> but then face to face now i know in part</string>
  <string> but then shall i know even as also i am known</string>
  <string>
 now abideth faith hope charity these three</string>
  <string> but the greatest of these is charity</string>
  <string>
 
 follow after charity and desire spiritual gifts but rather that ye may prophesy</string>
  <string>
 for he that speaketh in an unknown tongue speaketh not unto men but unto god for no man understandeth him </string>
  <string> howbeit in the spirit he speaketh mysteries</string>
  <string>
 but he that prophesieth speaketh unto men to edification and exhortation and comfort</string>
  <string>
 he that speaketh in an unknown tongue edifieth himself</string>
  <string> but he that prophesieth edifieth the church</string>
  <string>
 i would that ye all spake with tongues but rather that ye prophesied for greater is he that prophesieth than he that speaketh with tongues except he interpret that the church may receive edifying</string>
  <string>
 now brethren if i come unto you speaking with tongues what shall i profit you except i shall speak to you either by revelation or by knowledge or by prophesying or by doctrine</string>
  <string>
 even things without life giving sound whether pipe or harp except they give a distinction in the sounds how shall it be known what is piped or harped</string>
  <string>
 for if the trumpet give an uncertain sound who shall prepare himself to the battle</string>
  <string>
 so likewise ye except ye utter by the tongue words easy to be understood how shall it be known what is spoken</string>
  <string> for ye shall speak into the air</string>
  <string>
 there are it may be so many kinds of voices in the world and none of them is without signification</string>
  <string>
 therefore if i know not the meaning of the voice i shall be unto him that speaketh a barbarian and he that speaketh shall be a barbarian unto me</string>
  <string>
 even so ye forasmuch as ye are zealous of spiritual gifts seek that ye may excel to the edifying of the church</string>
  <string>
 wherefore let him that speaketh in an unknown tongue pray that he may interpret</string>
  <string>
 for if i pray in an unknown tongue my spirit prayeth but my understanding is unfruitful</string>
  <string>
 what is it then</string>
  <string> i will pray with the spirit and i will pray with the understanding also i will sing with the spirit and i will sing with the understanding also</string>
  <string>
 else when thou shalt bless with the spirit how shall he that occupieth the room of the unlearned say amen at thy giving of thanks seeing he understandeth not what thou sayest</string>
  <string>
 for thou verily givest thanks well but the other is not edified</string>
  <string>
 i thank my god i speak with tongues more than ye all
 yet in the church i had rather speak five words with my understanding that by my voice i might teach others also than ten thousand words in an unknown tongue</string>
  <string>
 brethren be not children in understanding howbeit in malice be ye children but in understanding be men</string>
  <string>
 in the law it is written with men of other tongues and other lips will i speak unto this people</string>
  <string> and yet for all that will they not hear me saith the lord</string>
  <string>
 wherefore tongues are for a sign not to them that believe but to them that believe not but prophesying serveth not for them that believe not but for them which believe</string>
  <string>
 if therefore the whole church be come together into one place and all speak with tongues and there come in those that are unlearned or unbelievers will they not say that ye are mad</string>
  <string>
 but if all prophesy and there come in one that believeth not or one unlearned he is convinced of all he is judged of all
 thus are the secrets of his heart made manifest</string>
  <string> and so falling down on his face he will worship god and report that god is in you of a truth</string>
  <string>
 how is it then brethren</string>
  <string> when ye come together every one of you hath a psalm hath a doctrine hath a tongue hath a revelation hath an interpretation</string>
  <string> let all things be done unto edifying</string>
  <string>
 if any man speak in an unknown tongue let it be by two or at the most by three and that by course</string>
  <string> and let one interpret</string>
  <string>
 but if there be no interpreter let him keep silence in the church</string>
  <string> and let him speak to himself and to god</string>
  <string>
 let the prophets speak two or three and let the other judge</string>
  <string>
 if any thing be revealed to another that sitteth by let the first hold his peace</string>
  <string>
 for ye may all prophesy one by one that all may learn and all may be comforted</string>
  <string>
 the spirits of the prophets are subject to the prophets</string>
  <string>
 for god is not the author of confusion but of peace as in all churches of the saints</string>
  <string>
 let your women keep silence in the churches for it is not permitted unto them to speak</string>
  <string> but they are commanded to be under obedience as also saith the law</string>
  <string>
 if they will learn any thing let them ask their husbands at home for it is a shame for women to speak in the church</string>
  <string>
 what</string>
  <string> came the word of god out from you</string>
  <string> or came it unto you only</string>
  <string>
 if any man think himself to be a prophet or spiritual let him acknowledge that the things that i write unto you are the commandments of the lord</string>
  <string>
 but if any man be ignorant let him be ignorant</string>
  <string>
 wherefore brethren covet to prophesy and forbid not to speak with tongues</string>
  <string>
 let all things be done decently and in order</string>
  <string>
 
 moreover brethren i declare unto you the gospel which i preached unto you which also ye have received and wherein ye stand</string>
  <string>
 by which also ye are saved if ye keep in memory what i preached unto you unless ye have believed in vain</string>
  <string>
 for i delivered unto you first of all that which i also received how that christ died for our sins according to the scriptures</string>
  <string>
 that he was buried and that he rose again the third day according to the scriptures
 that he was seen of cephas then of the twelve
 after that he was seen of above five hundred brethren at once</string>
  <string> of whom the greater part remain unto this present but some are fallen asleep</string>
  <string>
 after that he was seen of james</string>
  <string> then of all the apostles</string>
  <string>
 last of all he was seen of me also as of one born out of due time</string>
  <string>
 for i am the least of the apostles that am not meet to be called an apostle because i persecuted the church of god</string>
  <string>
 but by the grace of god i am what i am and his grace which was bestowed upon me was not in vain</string>
  <string> but i laboured more abundantly than they all yet not i but the grace of god which was with me</string>
  <string>
 therefore whether it were i or they so we preach and so ye believed</string>
  <string>
 now if christ be preached that he rose from the dead how say some among you that there is no resurrection of the dead</string>
  <string>
 but if there be no resurrection of the dead then is christ not risen
 if christ be not risen then is our preaching vain and your faith is also vain</string>
  <string>
 yea and we are found false witnesses of god</string>
  <string> because we have testified of god that he raised up christ whom he raised not up if so be that the dead rise not</string>
  <string>
 for if the dead rise not then is not christ raised
 if christ be not raised your faith is vain</string>
  <string> ye are yet in your sins</string>
  <string>
 then they also which are fallen asleep in christ are perished</string>
  <string>
 if in this life only we have hope in christ we are of all men most miserable</string>
  <string>
 but now is christ risen from the dead and become the firstfruits of them that slept</string>
  <string>
 for since by man came death by man came also the resurrection of the dead</string>
  <string>
 for as in adam all die even so in christ shall all be made alive</string>
  <string>
 but every man in his own order christ the firstfruits</string>
  <string> afterward they that are christ's at his coming</string>
  <string>
 then cometh the end when he shall have delivered up the kingdom to god even the father</string>
  <string> when he shall have put down all rule and all authority and power</string>
  <string>
 for he must reign till he hath put all enemies under his feet</string>
  <string>
 the last enemy that shall be destroyed is death</string>
  <string>
 for he hath put all things under his feet</string>
  <string> but when he saith all things are put under him it is manifest that he is excepted which did put all things under him</string>
  <string>
 when all things shall be subdued unto him then shall the son also himself be subject unto him that put all things under him that god may be all in all</string>
  <string>
 else what shall they do which are baptized for the dead if the dead rise not at all</string>
  <string> why are they then baptized for the dead</string>
  <string>
 why stand we in jeopardy every hour</string>
  <string>
 i protest by your rejoicing which i have in christ jesus our lord i die daily</string>
  <string>
 if after the manner of men i have fought with beasts at ephesus what advantageth it me if the dead rise not</string>
  <string> let us eat and drink</string>
  <string> for to morrow we die</string>
  <string>
 be not deceived evil communications corrupt good manners</string>
  <string>
 awake to righteousness and sin not</string>
  <string> for some have not the knowledge of god i speak this to your shame</string>
  <string>
 but some man will say how are the dead raised up</string>
  <string> and with what body do they come</string>
  <string>
 thou fool that which thou sowest is not quickened except it die
 that which thou sowest thou sowest not that body that shall be but bare grain it may chance of wheat or of some other grain 
 but god giveth it a body as it hath pleased him and to every seed his own body</string>
  <string>
 all flesh is not the same flesh but there is one kind of flesh of men another flesh of beasts another of fishes and another of birds</string>
  <string>
 there are also celestial bodies and bodies terrestrial but the glory of the celestial is one and the glory of the terrestrial is another</string>
  <string>
 there is one glory of the sun and another glory of the moon and another glory of the stars for one star differeth from another star in glory</string>
  <string>
 so also is the resurrection of the dead</string>
  <string> it is sown in corruption</string>
  <string> it is raised in incorruption
 it is sown in dishonour</string>
  <string> it is raised in glory it is sown in weakness</string>
  <string> it is raised in power
 it is sown a natural body</string>
  <string> it is raised a spiritual body</string>
  <string> there is a natural body and there is a spiritual body</string>
  <string>
 so it is written the first man adam was made a living soul</string>
  <string> the last adam was made a quickening spirit</string>
  <string>
 howbeit that was not first which is spiritual but that which is natural</string>
  <string> and afterward that which is spiritual</string>
  <string>
 the first man is of the earth earthy the second man is the lord from heaven</string>
  <string>
 as is the earthy such are they also that are earthy and as is the heavenly such are they also that are heavenly</string>
  <string>
 as we have borne the image of the earthy we shall also bear the image of the heavenly</string>
  <string>
 now this i say brethren that flesh and blood cannot inherit the kingdom of god</string>
  <string> neither doth corruption inherit incorruption</string>
  <string>
 behold i shew you a mystery</string>
  <string> we shall not all sleep but we shall all be changed
 in a moment in the twinkling of an eye at the last trump for the trumpet shall sound and the dead shall be raised incorruptible and we shall be changed</string>
  <string>
 for this corruptible must put on incorruption and this mortal must put on immortality</string>
  <string>
 so when this corruptible shall have put on incorruption and this mortal shall have put on immortality then shall be brought to pass the saying that is written death is swallowed up in victory</string>
  <string>
 o death where is thy sting</string>
  <string> o grave where is thy victory</string>
  <string>
 the sting of death is sin</string>
  <string> and the strength of sin is the law</string>
  <string>
 but thanks be to god which giveth us the victory through our lord jesus christ</string>
  <string>
 therefore my beloved brethren be ye stedfast unmoveable always abounding in the work of the lord forasmuch as ye know that your labour is not in vain in the lord</string>
  <string>
 
 now concerning the collection for the saints as i have given order to the churches of galatia even so do ye</string>
  <string>
 upon the first day of the week let every one of you lay by him in store as god hath prospered him that there be no gatherings when i come</string>
  <string>
 when i come whomsoever ye shall approve by your letters them will i send to bring your liberality unto jerusalem</string>
  <string>
 if it be meet that i go also they shall go with me</string>
  <string>
 now i will come unto you when i shall pass through macedonia for i do pass through macedonia</string>
  <string>
 it may be that i will abide yea and winter with you that ye may bring me on my journey whithersoever i go</string>
  <string>
 for i will not see you now by the way</string>
  <string> but i trust to tarry a while with you if the lord permit</string>
  <string>
 but i will tarry at ephesus until pentecost</string>
  <string>
 for a great door and effectual is opened unto me and there are many adversaries</string>
  <string>
 now if timotheus come see that he may be with you without fear for he worketh the work of the lord as i also do </string>
  <string>
 let no man therefore despise him but conduct him forth in peace that he may come unto me for i look for him with the brethren</string>
  <string>
 as touching our brother apollos i greatly desired him to come unto you with the brethren but his will was not at all to come at this time</string>
  <string> but he will come when he shall have convenient time</string>
  <string>
 watch ye stand fast in the faith quit you like men be strong</string>
  <string>
 let all your things be done with charity</string>
  <string>
 i beseech you brethren ye know the house of stephanas that it is the firstfruits of achaia and that they have addicted themselves to the ministry of the saints
 that ye submit yourselves unto such and to every one that helpeth with us and laboureth</string>
  <string>
 i am glad of the coming of stephanas and fortunatus and achaicus for that which was lacking on your part they have supplied</string>
  <string>
 for they have refreshed my spirit and your's therefore acknowledge ye them that are such</string>
  <string>
 the churches of asia salute you</string>
  <string> aquila and priscilla salute you much in the lord with the church that is in their house</string>
  <string>
 all the brethren greet you</string>
  <string> greet ye one another with an holy kiss</string>
  <string>
 the salutation of me paul with mine own hand</string>
  <string>
 if any man love not the lord jesus christ let him be anathema maranatha</string>
  <string>
 the grace of our lord jesus christ be with you</string>
  <string>
 my love be with you all in christ jesus</string>
  <string> amen</string>
  <string>
 the first epistle to the corinthians was written from philippi by stephanas and fortunatus and achaicus and timotheus</string>
  <string>
 the second epistle of paul the apostle to the corinthians
 
 paul an apostle of jesus christ by the will of god and timothy our brother unto the church of god which is at corinth with all the saints which are in all achaia
 grace be to you and peace from god our father and from the lord jesus christ</string>
  <string>
 blessed be god even the father of our lord jesus christ the father of mercies and the god of all comfort</string>
  <string>
 who comforteth us in all our tribulation that we may be able to comfort them which are in any trouble by the comfort wherewith we ourselves are comforted of god</string>
  <string>
 for as the sufferings of christ abound in us so our consolation also aboundeth by christ</string>
  <string>
 whether we be afflicted it is for your consolation and salvation which is effectual in the enduring of the same sufferings which we also suffer or whether we be comforted it is for your consolation and salvation</string>
  <string>
 our hope of you is stedfast knowing that as ye are partakers of the sufferings so shall ye be also of the consolation</string>
  <string>
 for we would not brethren have you ignorant of our trouble which came to us in asia that we were pressed out of measure above strength insomuch that we despaired even of life
 but we had the sentence of death in ourselves that we should not trust in ourselves but in god which raiseth the dead
 who delivered us from so great a death and doth deliver in whom we trust that he will yet deliver us </string>
  <string>
 ye also helping together by prayer for us that for the gift bestowed upon us by the means of many persons thanks may be given by many on our behalf</string>
  <string>
 for our rejoicing is this the testimony of our conscience that in simplicity and godly sincerity not with fleshly wisdom but by the grace of god we have had our conversation in the world and more abundantly to you-ward</string>
  <string>
 for we write none other things unto you than what ye read or acknowledge</string>
  <string> and i trust ye shall acknowledge even to the end</string>
  <string>
 as also ye have acknowledged us in part that we are your rejoicing even as ye also are our's in the day of the lord jesus</string>
  <string>
 in this confidence i was minded to come unto you before that ye might have a second benefit</string>
  <string>
 to pass by you into macedonia and to come again out of macedonia unto you and of you to be brought on my way toward judaea</string>
  <string>
 when i therefore was thus minded did i use lightness</string>
  <string> or the things that i purpose do i purpose according to the flesh that with me there should be yea yea and nay nay</string>
  <string>
 but as god is true our word toward you was not yea and nay</string>
  <string>
 for the son of god jesus christ who was preached among you by us even by me and silvanus and timotheus was not yea and nay but in him was yea</string>
  <string>
 for all the promises of god in him are yea and in him amen unto the glory of god by us</string>
  <string>
 now he which stablisheth us with you in christ and hath anointed us is god</string>
  <string>
 who hath also sealed us and given the earnest of the spirit in our hearts</string>
  <string>
 moreover i call god for a record upon my soul that to spare you i came not as yet unto corinth</string>
  <string>
 not for that we have dominion over your faith but are helpers of your joy for by faith ye stand</string>
  <string>
 
 but i determined this with myself that i would not come again to you in heaviness</string>
  <string>
 for if i make you sorry who is he then that maketh me glad but the same which is made sorry by me</string>
  <string>
 i wrote this same unto you lest when i came i should have sorrow from them of whom i ought to rejoice</string>
  <string> having confidence in you all that my joy is the joy of you all</string>
  <string>
 for out of much affliction and anguish of heart i wrote unto you with many tears</string>
  <string> not that ye should be grieved but that ye might know the love which i have more abundantly unto you</string>
  <string>
 but if any have caused grief he hath not grieved me but in part that i may not overcharge you all</string>
  <string>
 sufficient to such a man is this punishment which was inflicted of many</string>
  <string>
 so that contrariwise ye ought rather to forgive him and comfort him lest perhaps such a one should be swallowed up with overmuch sorrow</string>
  <string>
 wherefore i beseech you that ye would confirm your love toward him</string>
  <string>
 for to this end also did i write that i might know the proof of you whether ye be obedient in all things</string>
  <string>
 to whom ye forgive any thing i forgive also for if i forgave any thing to whom i forgave it for your sakes forgave i it in the person of christ</string>
  <string>
 lest satan should get an advantage of us for we are not ignorant of his devices</string>
  <string>
 furthermore when i came to troas to preach christ's gospel and a door was opened unto me of the lord
 i had no rest in my spirit because i found not titus my brother but taking my leave of them i went from thence into macedonia</string>
  <string>
 now thanks be unto god which always causeth us to triumph in christ and maketh manifest the savour of his knowledge by us in every place</string>
  <string>
 for we are unto god a sweet savour of christ in them that are saved and in them that perish
 to the one we are the savour of death unto death</string>
  <string> and to the other the savour of life unto life</string>
  <string> who is sufficient for these things</string>
  <string>
 for we are not as many which corrupt the word of god but as of sincerity but as of god in the sight of god speak we in christ</string>
  <string>
 
 do we begin again to commend ourselves</string>
  <string> or need we as some others epistles of commendation to you or letters of commendation from you</string>
  <string>
 ye are our epistle written in our hearts known and read of all men
 forasmuch as ye are manifestly declared to be the epistle of christ ministered by us written not with ink but with the spirit of the living god</string>
  <string> not in tables of stone but in fleshy tables of the heart</string>
  <string>
 such trust have we through christ to god-ward
 not that we are sufficient of ourselves to think any thing as of ourselves</string>
  <string> but our sufficiency is of god</string>
  <string>
 who also hath made us able ministers of the new testament</string>
  <string> not of the letter but of the spirit for the letter killeth but the spirit giveth life</string>
  <string>
 but if the ministration of death written and engraven in stones was glorious so that the children of israel could not stedfastly behold the face of moses for the glory of his countenance</string>
  <string> which glory was to be done away
 how shall not the ministration of the spirit be rather glorious</string>
  <string>
 for if the ministration of condemnation be glory much more doth the ministration of righteousness exceed in glory</string>
  <string>
 for even that which was made glorious had no glory in this respect by reason of the glory that excelleth</string>
  <string>
 for if that which is done away was glorious much more that which remaineth is glorious</string>
  <string>
 seeing then that we have such hope we use great plainness of speech
 not as moses which put a vail over his face that the children of israel could not stedfastly look to the end of that which is abolished
 but their minds were blinded for until this day remaineth the same vail untaken away in the reading of the old testament</string>
  <string> which vail is done away in christ</string>
  <string>
 but even unto this day when moses is read the vail is upon their heart</string>
  <string>
 nevertheless when it shall turn to the lord the vail shall be taken away</string>
  <string>
 now the lord is that spirit and where the spirit of the lord is there is liberty</string>
  <string>
 but we all with open face beholding as in a glass the glory of the lord are changed into the same image from glory to glory even as by the spirit of the lord</string>
  <string>
 
 therefore seeing we have this ministry as we have received mercy we faint not</string>
  <string>
 but have renounced the hidden things of dishonesty not walking in craftiness nor handling the word of god deceitfully</string>
  <string> but by manifestation of the truth commending ourselves to every man's conscience in the sight of god</string>
  <string>
 but if our gospel be hid it is hid to them that are lost
 in whom the god of this world hath blinded the minds of them which believe not lest the light of the glorious gospel of christ who is the image of god should shine unto them</string>
  <string>
 for we preach not ourselves but christ jesus the lord</string>
  <string> and ourselves your servants for jesus' sake</string>
  <string>
 for god who commanded the light to shine out of darkness hath shined in our hearts to give the light of the knowledge of the glory of god in the face of jesus christ</string>
  <string>
 but we have this treasure in earthen vessels that the excellency of the power may be of god and not of us</string>
  <string>
 we are troubled on every side yet not distressed</string>
  <string> we are perplexed but not in despair</string>
  <string>
 persecuted but not forsaken</string>
  <string> cast down but not destroyed</string>
  <string>
 always bearing about in the body the dying of the lord jesus that the life also of jesus might be made manifest in our body</string>
  <string>
 for we which live are alway delivered unto death for jesus' sake that the life also of jesus might be made manifest in our mortal flesh</string>
  <string>
 so then death worketh in us but life in you</string>
  <string>
 we having the same spirit of faith according as it is written i believed and therefore have i spoken</string>
  <string> we also believe and therefore speak</string>
  <string>
 knowing that he which raised up the lord jesus shall raise up us also by jesus and shall present us with you</string>
  <string>
 for all things are for your sakes that the abundant grace might through the thanksgiving of many redound to the glory of god</string>
  <string>
 for which cause we faint not</string>
  <string> but though our outward man perish yet the inward man is renewed day by day</string>
  <string>
 for our light affliction which is but for a moment worketh for us a far more exceeding and eternal weight of glory</string>
  <string>
 while we look not at the things which are seen but at the things which are not seen for the things which are seen are temporal</string>
  <string> but the things which are not seen are eternal</string>
  <string>
 
 for we know that if our earthly house of this tabernacle were dissolved we have a building of god an house not made with hands eternal in the heavens</string>
  <string>
 for in this we groan earnestly desiring to be clothed upon with our house which is from heaven
 if so be that being clothed we shall not be found naked</string>
  <string>
 for we that are in this tabernacle do groan being burdened not for that we would be unclothed but clothed upon that mortality might be swallowed up of life</string>
  <string>
 now he that hath wrought us for the selfsame thing is god who also hath given unto us the earnest of the spirit</string>
  <string>
 therefore we are always confident knowing that whilst we are at home in the body we are absent from the lord
 for we walk by faith not by sight
 we are confident i say and willing rather to be absent from the body and to be present with the lord</string>
  <string>
 wherefore we labour that whether present or absent we may be accepted of him</string>
  <string>
 for we must all appear before the judgment seat of christ</string>
  <string> that every one may receive the things done in his body according to that he hath done whether it be good or bad</string>
  <string>
 knowing therefore the terror of the lord we persuade men</string>
  <string> but we are made manifest unto god</string>
  <string> and i trust also are made manifest in your consciences</string>
  <string>
 for we commend not ourselves again unto you but give you occasion to glory on our behalf that ye may have somewhat to answer them which glory in appearance and not in heart</string>
  <string>
 for whether we be beside ourselves it is to god or whether we be sober it is for your cause</string>
  <string>
 for the love of christ constraineth us</string>
  <string> because we thus judge that if one died for all then were all dead
 that he died for all that they which live should not henceforth live unto themselves but unto him which died for them and rose again</string>
  <string>
 wherefore henceforth know we no man after the flesh yea though we have known christ after the flesh yet now henceforth know we him no more</string>
  <string>
 therefore if any man be in christ he is a new creature old things are passed away</string>
  <string> behold all things are become new</string>
  <string>
 all things are of god who hath reconciled us to himself by jesus christ and hath given to us the ministry of reconciliation</string>
  <string>
 to wit that god was in christ reconciling the world unto himself not imputing their trespasses unto them</string>
  <string> and hath committed unto us the word of reconciliation</string>
  <string>
 now then we are ambassadors for christ as though god did beseech you by us we pray you in christ's stead be ye reconciled to god</string>
  <string>
 for he hath made him to be sin for us who knew no sin</string>
  <string> that we might be made the righteousness of god in him</string>
  <string>
 
 we then as workers together with him beseech you also that ye receive not the grace of god in vain</string>
  <string>
 for he saith i have heard thee in a time accepted and in the day of salvation have i succoured thee behold now is the accepted time</string>
  <string> behold now is the day of salvation</string>
  <string>
 giving no offence in any thing that the ministry be not blamed
 but in all things approving ourselves as the ministers of god in much patience in afflictions in necessities in distresses
 in stripes in imprisonments in tumults in labours in watchings in fastings</string>
  <string>
 by pureness by knowledge by longsuffering by kindness by the holy ghost by love unfeigned
 by the word of truth by the power of god by the armour of righteousness on the right hand and on the left
 by honour and dishonour by evil report and good report as deceivers and yet true</string>
  <string>
 as unknown and yet well known</string>
  <string> as dying and behold we live</string>
  <string> as chastened and not killed</string>
  <string>
 as sorrowful yet alway rejoicing</string>
  <string> as poor yet making many rich</string>
  <string> as having nothing and yet possessing all things</string>
  <string>
 o ye corinthians our mouth is open unto you our heart is enlarged</string>
  <string>
 ye are not straitened in us but ye are straitened in your own bowels</string>
  <string>
 now for a recompence in the same i speak as unto my children be ye also enlarged</string>
  <string>
 be ye not unequally yoked together with unbelievers for what fellowship hath righteousness with unrighteousness</string>
  <string> and what communion hath light with darkness</string>
  <string>
 what concord hath christ with belial</string>
  <string> or what part hath he that believeth with an infidel</string>
  <string>
 what agreement hath the temple of god with idols</string>
  <string> for ye are the temple of the living god</string>
  <string> as god hath said i will dwell in them and walk in them </string>
  <string> and i will be their god and they shall be my people</string>
  <string>
 wherefore come out from among them and be ye separate saith the lord and touch not the unclean thing </string>
  <string> and i will receive you
 will be a father unto you and ye shall be my sons and daughters saith the lord almighty</string>
  <string>
 
 having therefore these promises dearly beloved let us cleanse ourselves from all filthiness of the flesh and spirit perfecting holiness in the fear of god</string>
  <string>
 receive us</string>
  <string> we have wronged no man we have corrupted no man we have defrauded no man</string>
  <string>
 i speak not this to condemn you  for i have said before that ye are in our hearts to die and live with you </string>
  <string>
 great is my boldness of speech toward you great is my glorying of you i am filled with comfort i am exceeding joyful in all our tribulation</string>
  <string>
 for when we were come into macedonia our flesh had no rest but we were troubled on every side</string>
  <string> without were fightings within were fears</string>
  <string>
 nevertheless god that comforteth those that are cast down comforted us by the coming of titus</string>
  <string>
 not by his coming only but by the consolation wherewith he was comforted in you when he told us your earnest desire your mourning your fervent mind toward me</string>
  <string> so that i rejoiced the more</string>
  <string>
 for though i made you sorry with a letter i do not repent though i did repent for i perceive that the same epistle hath made you sorry though it were but for a season</string>
  <string>
 now i rejoice not that ye were made sorry but that ye sorrowed to repentance for ye were made sorry after a godly manner that ye might receive damage by us in nothing</string>
  <string>
 for godly sorrow worketh repentance to salvation not to be repented of but the sorrow of the world worketh death</string>
  <string>
 for behold this selfsame thing that ye sorrowed after a godly sort what carefulness it wrought in you yea what clearing of yourselves yea what indignation yea what fear yea what vehement desire yea what zeal yea what revenge</string>
  <string> in all things ye have approved yourselves to be clear in this matter</string>
  <string>
 wherefore though i wrote unto you i did it not for his cause that had done the wrong nor for his cause that suffered wrong but that our care for you in the sight of god might appear unto you</string>
  <string>
 therefore we were comforted in your comfort yea and exceedingly the more joyed we for the joy of titus because his spirit was refreshed by you all</string>
  <string>
 for if i have boasted any thing to him of you i am not ashamed</string>
  <string> but as we spake all things to you in truth even so our boasting which i made before titus is found a truth</string>
  <string>
 his inward affection is more abundant toward you whilst he remembereth the obedience of you all how with fear and trembling ye received him</string>
  <string>
 i rejoice therefore that i have confidence in you in all things </string>
  <string>
 
 moreover brethren we do you to wit of the grace of god bestowed on the churches of macedonia</string>
  <string>
 how that in a great trial of affliction the abundance of their joy and their deep poverty abounded unto the riches of their liberality</string>
  <string>
 for to their power i bear record yea and beyond their power they were willing of themselves</string>
  <string>
 praying us with much intreaty that we would receive the gift and take upon us the fellowship of the ministering to the saints</string>
  <string>
 this they did not as we hoped but first gave their own selves to the lord and unto us by the will of god</string>
  <string>
 insomuch that we desired titus that as he had begun so he would also finish in you the same grace also</string>
  <string>
 therefore as ye abound in every thing in faith and utterance and knowledge and in all diligence and in your love to us see that ye abound in this grace also</string>
  <string>
 i speak not by commandment but by occasion of the forwardness of others and to prove the sincerity of your love</string>
  <string>
 for ye know the grace of our lord jesus christ that though he was rich yet for your sakes he became poor that ye through his poverty might be rich</string>
  <string>
 herein i give my advice for this is expedient for you who have begun before not only to do but also to be forward a year ago</string>
  <string>
 now therefore perform the doing of it </string>
  <string> that as there was a readiness to will so there may be a performance also out of that which ye have</string>
  <string>
 for if there be first a willing mind it is accepted according to that a man hath and not according to that he hath not</string>
  <string>
 for i mean not that other men be eased and ye burdened
 but by an equality that now at this time your abundance may be a supply for their want that their abundance also may be a supply for your want that there may be equality
 as it is written he that had gathered much had nothing over</string>
  <string> and he that had gathered little had no lack</string>
  <string>
 but thanks be to god which put the same earnest care into the heart of titus for you</string>
  <string>
 for indeed he accepted the exhortation</string>
  <string> but being more forward of his own accord he went unto you</string>
  <string>
 we have sent with him the brother whose praise is in the gospel throughout all the churches</string>
  <string>
 not that only but who was also chosen of the churches to travel with us with this grace which is administered by us to the glory of the same lord and declaration of your ready mind
 avoiding this that no man should blame us in this abundance which is administered by us
 providing for honest things not only in the sight of the lord but also in the sight of men</string>
  <string>
 we have sent with them our brother whom we have oftentimes proved diligent in many things but now much more diligent upon the great confidence which i have in you</string>
  <string>
 whether any do enquire of titus he is my partner and fellowhelper concerning you or our brethren be enquired of they are the messengers of the churches and the glory of christ</string>
  <string>
 wherefore shew ye to them and before the churches the proof of your love and of our boasting on your behalf</string>
  <string>
 
 for as touching the ministering to the saints it is superfluous for me to write to you
 for i know the forwardness of your mind for which i boast of you to them of macedonia that achaia was ready a year ago</string>
  <string> and your zeal hath provoked very many</string>
  <string>
 yet have i sent the brethren lest our boasting of you should be in vain in this behalf</string>
  <string> that as i said ye may be ready
 lest haply if they of macedonia come with me and find you unprepared we that we say not ye should be ashamed in this same confident boasting</string>
  <string>
 therefore i thought it necessary to exhort the brethren that they would go before unto you and make up beforehand your bounty whereof ye had notice before that the same might be ready as a matter of bounty and not as of covetousness</string>
  <string>
 but this i say he which soweth sparingly shall reap also sparingly</string>
  <string> and he which soweth bountifully shall reap also bountifully</string>
  <string>
 every man according as he purposeth in his heart so let him give </string>
  <string> not grudgingly or of necessity for god loveth a cheerful giver</string>
  <string>
 god is able to make all grace abound toward you</string>
  <string> that ye always having all sufficiency in all things may abound to every good work
 as it is written he hath dispersed abroad</string>
  <string> he hath given to the poor his righteousness remaineth for ever</string>
  <string>
 now he that ministereth seed to the sower both minister bread for your food and multiply your seed sown and increase the fruits of your righteousness</string>
  <string>
 being enriched in every thing to all bountifulness which causeth through us thanksgiving to god</string>
  <string>
 for the administration of this service not only supplieth the want of the saints but is abundant also by many thanksgivings unto god</string>
  <string>
 whiles by the experiment of this ministration they glorify god for your professed subjection unto the gospel of christ and for your liberal distribution unto them and unto all men </string>
  <string>
 by their prayer for you which long after you for the exceeding grace of god in you</string>
  <string>
 thanks be unto god for his unspeakable gift</string>
  <string>
 
 now i paul myself beseech you by the meekness and gentleness of christ who in presence am base among you but being absent am bold toward you
 but i beseech you that i may not be bold when i am present with that confidence wherewith i think to be bold against some which think of us as if we walked according to the flesh</string>
  <string>
 for though we walk in the flesh we do not war after the flesh
 for the weapons of our warfare are not carnal but mighty through god to the pulling down of strong holds</string>
  <string>
 casting down imaginations and every high thing that exalteth itself against the knowledge of god and bringing into captivity every thought to the obedience of christ</string>
  <string>
 having in a readiness to revenge all disobedience when your obedience is fulfilled</string>
  <string>
 do ye look on things after the outward appearance</string>
  <string> if any man trust to himself that he is christ's let him of himself think this again that as he is christ's even so are we christ's</string>
  <string>
 for though i should boast somewhat more of our authority which the lord hath given us for edification and not for your destruction i should not be ashamed
 that i may not seem as if i would terrify you by letters</string>
  <string>
 for his letters say they are weighty and powerful</string>
  <string> but his bodily presence is weak and his speech contemptible</string>
  <string>
 let such an one think this that such as we are in word by letters when we are absent such will we be also in deed when we are present</string>
  <string>
 for we dare not make ourselves of the number or compare ourselves with some that commend themselves but they measuring themselves by themselves and comparing themselves among themselves are not wise</string>
  <string>
 but we will not boast of things without our measure but according to the measure of the rule which god hath distributed to us a measure to reach even unto you</string>
  <string>
 for we stretch not ourselves beyond our measure as though we reached not unto you for we are come as far as to you also in preaching the gospel of christ
 not boasting of things without our measure that is of other men's labours</string>
  <string> but having hope when your faith is increased that we shall be enlarged by you according to our rule abundantly
 to preach the gospel in the regions beyond you and not to boast in another man's line of things made ready to our hand</string>
  <string>
 but he that glorieth let him glory in the lord</string>
  <string>
 for not he that commendeth himself is approved but whom the lord commendeth</string>
  <string>
 
 would to god ye could bear with me a little in my folly and indeed bear with me</string>
  <string>
 for i am jealous over you with godly jealousy for i have espoused you to one husband that i may present you as a chaste virgin to christ</string>
  <string>
 but i fear lest by any means as the serpent beguiled eve through his subtilty so your minds should be corrupted from the simplicity that is in christ</string>
  <string>
 for if he that cometh preacheth another jesus whom we have not preached or if ye receive another spirit which ye have not received or another gospel which ye have not accepted ye might well bear with him </string>
  <string>
 for i suppose i was not a whit behind the very chiefest apostles</string>
  <string>
 but though i be rude in speech yet not in knowledge</string>
  <string> but we have been throughly made manifest among you in all things</string>
  <string>
 have i committed an offence in abasing myself that ye might be exalted because i have preached to you the gospel of god freely</string>
  <string>
 i robbed other churches taking wages of them to do you service</string>
  <string>
 when i was present with you and wanted i was chargeable to no man for that which was lacking to me the brethren which came from macedonia supplied and in all things i have kept myself from being burdensome unto you and so will i keep myself </string>
  <string>
 as the truth of christ is in me no man shall stop me of this boasting in the regions of achaia</string>
  <string>
 wherefore</string>
  <string> because i love you not</string>
  <string> god knoweth</string>
  <string>
 but what i do that i will do that i may cut off occasion from them which desire occasion</string>
  <string> that wherein they glory they may be found even as we</string>
  <string>
 for such are false apostles deceitful workers transforming themselves into the apostles of christ</string>
  <string>
 no marvel</string>
  <string> for satan himself is transformed into an angel of light</string>
  <string>
 therefore it is no great thing if his ministers also be transformed as the ministers of righteousness</string>
  <string> whose end shall be according to their works</string>
  <string>
 i say again let no man think me a fool</string>
  <string> if otherwise yet as a fool receive me that i may boast myself a little</string>
  <string>
 that which i speak i speak it not after the lord but as it were foolishly in this confidence of boasting</string>
  <string>
 seeing that many glory after the flesh i will glory also</string>
  <string>
 for ye suffer fools gladly seeing ye yourselves are wise</string>
  <string>
 for ye suffer if a man bring you into bondage if a man devour you if a man take of you if a man exalt himself if a man smite you on the face</string>
  <string>
 i speak as concerning reproach as though we had been weak</string>
  <string> howbeit whereinsoever any is bold i speak foolishly i am bold also</string>
  <string>
 are they hebrews</string>
  <string> so am i</string>
  <string> are they israelites</string>
  <string> so am i</string>
  <string> are they the seed of abraham</string>
  <string> so am i</string>
  <string>
 are they ministers of christ</string>
  <string> i speak as a fool i am more</string>
  <string> in labours more abundant in stripes above measure in prisons more frequent in deaths oft</string>
  <string>
 of the jews five times received i forty stripes save one</string>
  <string>
 thrice was i beaten with rods once was i stoned thrice i suffered shipwreck a night and a day i have been in the deep</string>
  <string>
 in journeyings often in perils of waters in perils of robbers in perils by mine own countrymen in perils by the heathen in perils in the city in perils in the wilderness in perils in the sea in perils among false brethren</string>
  <string>
 in weariness and painfulness in watchings often in hunger and thirst in fastings often in cold and nakedness</string>
  <string>
 beside those things that are without that which cometh upon me daily the care of all the churches</string>
  <string>
 who is weak and i am not weak</string>
  <string> who is offended and i burn not</string>
  <string>
 if i must needs glory i will glory of the things which concern mine infirmities</string>
  <string>
 the god and father of our lord jesus christ which is blessed for evermore knoweth that i lie not</string>
  <string>
 in damascus the governor under aretas the king kept the city of the damascenes with a garrison desirous to apprehend me
 through a window in a basket was i let down by the wall and escaped his hands</string>
  <string>
 
 it is not expedient for me doubtless to glory</string>
  <string> i will come to visions and revelations of the lord</string>
  <string>
 i knew a man in christ above fourteen years ago whether in the body i cannot tell</string>
  <string> or whether out of the body i cannot tell god knoweth</string>
  <string> such an one caught up to the third heaven</string>
  <string>
 i knew such a man whether in the body or out of the body i cannot tell god knoweth</string>
  <string>
 how that he was caught up into paradise and heard unspeakable words which it is not lawful for a man to utter</string>
  <string>
 of such an one will i glory yet of myself i will not glory but in mine infirmities</string>
  <string>
 for though i would desire to glory i shall not be a fool</string>
  <string> for i will say the truth but now i forbear lest any man should think of me above that which he seeth me to be or that he heareth of me</string>
  <string>
 lest i should be exalted above measure through the abundance of the revelations there was given to me a thorn in the flesh the messenger of satan to buffet me lest i should be exalted above measure</string>
  <string>
 for this thing i besought the lord thrice that it might depart from me</string>
  <string>
 he said unto me my grace is sufficient for thee for my strength is made perfect in weakness</string>
  <string> most gladly therefore will i rather glory in my infirmities that the power of christ may rest upon me</string>
  <string>
 therefore i take pleasure in infirmities in reproaches in necessities in persecutions in distresses for christ's sake for when i am weak then am i strong</string>
  <string>
 i am become a fool in glorying</string>
  <string> ye have compelled me for i ought to have been commended of you for in nothing am i behind the very chiefest apostles though i be nothing</string>
  <string>
 truly the signs of an apostle were wrought among you in all patience in signs and wonders and mighty deeds</string>
  <string>
 for what is it wherein ye were inferior to other churches except it be that i myself was not burdensome to you</string>
  <string> forgive me this wrong</string>
  <string>
 behold the third time i am ready to come to you</string>
  <string> and i will not be burdensome to you for i seek not your's but you for the children ought not to lay up for the parents but the parents for the children</string>
  <string>
 i will very gladly spend and be spent for you</string>
  <string> though the more abundantly i love you the less i be loved</string>
  <string>
 but be it so i did not burden you nevertheless being crafty i caught you with guile</string>
  <string>
 did i make a gain of you by any of them whom i sent unto you</string>
  <string>
 i desired titus and with him i sent a brother</string>
  <string> did titus make a gain of you</string>
  <string> walked we not in the same spirit</string>
  <string> walked we not in the same steps</string>
  <string>
 again think ye that we excuse ourselves unto you</string>
  <string> we speak before god in christ but we do all things dearly beloved for your edifying</string>
  <string>
 for i fear lest when i come i shall not find you such as i would and that i shall be found unto you such as ye would not lest there be debates envyings wraths strifes backbitings whisperings swellings tumults
 lest when i come again my god will humble me among you and that i shall bewail many which have sinned already and have not repented of the uncleanness and fornication and lasciviousness which they have committed</string>
  <string>
 
 this is the third time i am coming to you</string>
  <string> in the mouth of two or three witnesses shall every word be established</string>
  <string>
 i told you before and foretell you as if i were present the second time</string>
  <string> and being absent now i write to them which heretofore have sinned and to all other that if i come again i will not spare
 since ye seek a proof of christ speaking in me which to you-ward is not weak but is mighty in you</string>
  <string>
 for though he was crucified through weakness yet he liveth by the power of god</string>
  <string> for we also are weak in him but we shall live with him by the power of god toward you</string>
  <string>
 examine yourselves whether ye be in the faith</string>
  <string> prove your own selves</string>
  <string> know ye not your own selves how that jesus christ is in you except ye be reprobates</string>
  <string>
 but i trust that ye shall know that we are not reprobates</string>
  <string>
 now i pray to god that ye do no evil</string>
  <string> not that we should appear approved but that ye should do that which is honest though we be as reprobates</string>
  <string>
 for we can do nothing against the truth but for the truth</string>
  <string>
 for we are glad when we are weak and ye are strong and this also we wish even your perfection</string>
  <string>
 therefore i write these things being absent lest being present i should use sharpness according to the power which the lord hath given me to edification and not to destruction</string>
  <string>
 finally brethren farewell</string>
  <string> be perfect be of good comfort be of one mind live in peace</string>
  <string> and the god of love and peace shall be with you</string>
  <string>
 greet one another with an holy kiss</string>
  <string>
 all the saints salute you</string>
  <string>
 the grace of the lord jesus christ and the love of god and the communion of the holy ghost be with you all</string>
  <string> amen</string>
  <string>
 the second epistle to the corinthians was written from philippi a city of macedonia by titus and lucas</string>
  <string>
 the epistle of paul the apostle to the galatians
 
 paul an apostle not of men neither by man but by jesus christ and god the father who raised him from the dead</string>
  <string>
 all the brethren which are with me unto the churches of galatia
 grace be to you and peace from god the father and from our lord jesus christ
 who gave himself for our sins that he might deliver us from this present evil world according to the will of god and our father
 to whom be glory for ever and ever</string>
  <string> amen</string>
  <string>
 i marvel that ye are so soon removed from him that called you into the grace of christ unto another gospel
 which is not another</string>
  <string> but there be some that trouble you and would pervert the gospel of christ</string>
  <string>
 but though we or an angel from heaven preach any other gospel unto you than that which we have preached unto you let him be accursed</string>
  <string>
 as we said before so say i now again if any man preach any other gospel unto you than that ye have received let him be accursed</string>
  <string>
 for do i now persuade men or god</string>
  <string> or do i seek to please men</string>
  <string> for if i yet pleased men i should not be the servant of christ</string>
  <string>
 but i certify you brethren that the gospel which was preached of me is not after man</string>
  <string>
 for i neither received it of man neither was i taught it but by the revelation of jesus christ</string>
  <string>
 for ye have heard of my conversation in time past in the jews' religion how that beyond measure i persecuted the church of god and wasted it
 profited in the jews' religion above many my equals in mine own nation being more exceedingly zealous of the traditions of my fathers</string>
  <string>
 but when it pleased god who separated me from my mother's womb and called me by his grace
 to reveal his son in me that i might preach him among the heathen</string>
  <string> immediately i conferred not with flesh and blood
 neither went i up to jerusalem to them which were apostles before me</string>
  <string> but i went into arabia and returned again unto damascus</string>
  <string>
 then after three years i went up to jerusalem to see peter and abode with him fifteen days</string>
  <string>
 but other of the apostles saw i none save james the lord's brother</string>
  <string>
 now the things which i write unto you behold before god i lie not</string>
  <string>
 afterwards i came into the regions of syria and cilicia</string>
  <string>
 was unknown by face unto the churches of judaea which were in christ
 but they had heard only that he which persecuted us in times past now preacheth the faith which once he destroyed</string>
  <string>
 they glorified god in me</string>
  <string>
 
 then fourteen years after i went up again to jerusalem with barnabas and took titus with me also</string>
  <string>
 i went up by revelation and communicated unto them that gospel which i preach among the gentiles but privately to them which were of reputation lest by any means i should run or had run in vain</string>
  <string>
 but neither titus who was with me being a greek was compelled to be circumcised
 that because of false brethren unawares brought in who came in privily to spy out our liberty which we have in christ jesus that they might bring us into bondage
 to whom we gave place by subjection no not for an hour</string>
  <string> that the truth of the gospel might continue with you</string>
  <string>
 but of these who seemed to be somewhat whatsoever they were it maketh no matter to me god accepteth no man's person for they who seemed to be somewhat in conference added nothing to me
 but contrariwise when they saw that the gospel of the uncircumcision was committed unto me as the gospel of the circumcision was unto peter</string>
  <string>
 for he that wrought effectually in peter to the apostleship of the circumcision the same was mighty in me toward the gentiles
 when james cephas and john who seemed to be pillars perceived the grace that was given unto me they gave to me and barnabas the right hands of fellowship</string>
  <string> that we should go unto the heathen and they unto the circumcision</string>
  <string>
 only they would that we should remember the poor</string>
  <string> the same which i also was forward to do</string>
  <string>
 but when peter was come to antioch i withstood him to the face because he was to be blamed</string>
  <string>
 for before that certain came from james he did eat with the gentiles but when they were come he withdrew and separated himself fearing them which were of the circumcision</string>
  <string>
 the other jews dissembled likewise with him</string>
  <string> insomuch that barnabas also was carried away with their dissimulation</string>
  <string>
 but when i saw that they walked not uprightly according to the truth of the gospel i said unto peter before them all if thou being a jew livest after the manner of gentiles and not as do the jews why compellest thou the gentiles to live as do the jews</string>
  <string>
 we who are jews by nature and not sinners of the gentiles
 knowing that a man is not justified by the works of the law but by the faith of jesus christ even we have believed in jesus christ that we might be justified by the faith of christ and not by the works of the law for by the works of the law shall no flesh be justified</string>
  <string>
 but if while we seek to be justified by christ we ourselves also are found sinners is therefore christ the minister of sin</string>
  <string> god forbid</string>
  <string>
 for if i build again the things which i destroyed i make myself a transgressor</string>
  <string>
 for i through the law am dead to the law that i might live unto god</string>
  <string>
 i am crucified with christ nevertheless i live</string>
  <string> yet not i but christ liveth in me and the life which i now live in the flesh i live by the faith of the son of god who loved me and gave himself for me</string>
  <string>
 i do not frustrate the grace of god for if righteousness come by the law then christ is dead in vain</string>
  <string>
 
 o foolish galatians who hath bewitched you that ye should not obey the truth before whose eyes jesus christ hath been evidently set forth crucified among you</string>
  <string>
 this only would i learn of you received ye the spirit by the works of the law or by the hearing of faith</string>
  <string>
 are ye so foolish</string>
  <string> having begun in the spirit are ye now made perfect by the flesh</string>
  <string>
 have ye suffered so many things in vain</string>
  <string> if it be yet in vain</string>
  <string>
 he therefore that ministereth to you the spirit and worketh miracles among you doeth he it by the works of the law or by the hearing of faith</string>
  <string>
 even as abraham believed god and it was accounted to him for righteousness</string>
  <string>
 know ye therefore that they which are of faith the same are the children of abraham</string>
  <string>
 the scripture foreseeing that god would justify the heathen through faith preached before the gospel unto abraham saying in thee shall all nations be blessed</string>
  <string>
 so then they which be of faith are blessed with faithful abraham</string>
  <string>
 for as many as are of the works of the law are under the curse for it is written cursed is every one that continueth not in all things which are written in the book of the law to do them</string>
  <string>
 but that no man is justified by the law in the sight of god it is evident for the just shall live by faith</string>
  <string>
 the law is not of faith but the man that doeth them shall live in them</string>
  <string>
 christ hath redeemed us from the curse of the law being made a curse for us for it is written cursed is every one that hangeth on a tree
 that the blessing of abraham might come on the gentiles through jesus christ</string>
  <string> that we might receive the promise of the spirit through faith</string>
  <string>
 brethren i speak after the manner of men</string>
  <string> though it be but a man's covenant yet if it be confirmed no man disannulleth or addeth thereto</string>
  <string>
 now to abraham and his seed were the promises made</string>
  <string> he saith not to seeds as of many</string>
  <string> but as of one to thy seed which is christ</string>
  <string>
 this i say that the covenant that was confirmed before of god in christ the law which was four hundred and thirty years after cannot disannul that it should make the promise of none effect</string>
  <string>
 for if the inheritance be of the law it is no more of promise but god gave it to abraham by promise</string>
  <string>
 wherefore then serveth the law</string>
  <string> it was added because of transgressions till the seed should come to whom the promise was made</string>
  <string> and it was ordained by angels in the hand of a mediator</string>
  <string>
 now a mediator is not a mediator of one but god is one</string>
  <string>
 is the law then against the promises of god</string>
  <string> god forbid for if there had been a law given which could have given life verily righteousness should have been by the law</string>
  <string>
 but the scripture hath concluded all under sin that the promise by faith of jesus christ might be given to them that believe</string>
  <string>
 but before faith came we were kept under the law shut up unto the faith which should afterwards be revealed</string>
  <string>
 wherefore the law was our schoolmaster to bring us unto christ that we might be justified by faith</string>
  <string>
 but after that faith is come we are no longer under a schoolmaster</string>
  <string>
 for ye are all the children of god by faith in christ jesus</string>
  <string>
 for as many of you as have been baptized into christ have put on christ</string>
  <string>
 there is neither jew nor greek there is neither bond nor free there is neither male nor female for ye are all one in christ jesus</string>
  <string>
 if ye be christ's then are ye abraham's seed and heirs according to the promise</string>
  <string>
 
 now i say that the heir as long as he is a child differeth nothing from a servant though he be lord of all</string>
  <string>
 but is under tutors and governors until the time appointed of the father</string>
  <string>
 even so we when we were children were in bondage under the elements of the world
 but when the fulness of the time was come god sent forth his son made of a woman made under the law
 to redeem them that were under the law that we might receive the adoption of sons</string>
  <string>
 because ye are sons god hath sent forth the spirit of his son into your hearts crying abba father</string>
  <string>
 wherefore thou art no more a servant but a son</string>
  <string> and if a son then an heir of god through christ</string>
  <string>
 howbeit then when ye knew not god ye did service unto them which by nature are no gods</string>
  <string>
 but now after that ye have known god or rather are known of god how turn ye again to the weak and beggarly elements whereunto ye desire again to be in bondage</string>
  <string>
 ye observe days and months and times and years</string>
  <string>
 i am afraid of you lest i have bestowed upon you labour in vain</string>
  <string>
 brethren i beseech you be as i am </string>
  <string> for i am as ye are  ye have not injured me at all</string>
  <string>
 ye know how through infirmity of the flesh i preached the gospel unto you at the first</string>
  <string>
 my temptation which was in my flesh ye despised not nor rejected</string>
  <string> but received me as an angel of god even as christ jesus</string>
  <string>
 where is then the blessedness ye spake of</string>
  <string> for i bear you record that if it had been possible ye would have plucked out your own eyes and have given them to me</string>
  <string>
 am i therefore become your enemy because i tell you the truth</string>
  <string>
 they zealously affect you but not well</string>
  <string> yea they would exclude you that ye might affect them</string>
  <string>
 but it is good to be zealously affected always in a good thing and not only when i am present with you</string>
  <string>
 my little children of whom i travail in birth again until christ be formed in you
 i desire to be present with you now and to change my voice</string>
  <string> for i stand in doubt of you</string>
  <string>
 tell me ye that desire to be under the law do ye not hear the law</string>
  <string>
 for it is written that abraham had two sons the one by a bondmaid the other by a freewoman</string>
  <string>
 but he who was of the bondwoman was born after the flesh</string>
  <string> but he of the freewoman was by promise</string>
  <string>
 which things are an allegory for these are the two covenants</string>
  <string> the one from the mount sinai which gendereth to bondage which is agar</string>
  <string>
 for this agar is mount sinai in arabia and answereth to jerusalem which now is and is in bondage with her children</string>
  <string>
 but jerusalem which is above is free which is the mother of us all</string>
  <string>
 for it is written rejoice thou barren that bearest not</string>
  <string> break forth and cry thou that travailest not for the desolate hath many more children than she which hath an husband</string>
  <string>
 now we brethren as isaac was are the children of promise</string>
  <string>
 but as then he that was born after the flesh persecuted him that was born after the spirit even so it is now</string>
  <string>
 nevertheless what saith the scripture</string>
  <string> cast out the bondwoman and her son for the son of the bondwoman shall not be heir with the son of the freewoman</string>
  <string>
 so then brethren we are not children of the bondwoman but of the free</string>
  <string>
 
 stand fast therefore in the liberty wherewith christ hath made us free and be not entangled again with the yoke of bondage</string>
  <string>
 behold i paul say unto you that if ye be circumcised christ shall profit you nothing</string>
  <string>
 for i testify again to every man that is circumcised that he is a debtor to do the whole law</string>
  <string>
 christ is become of no effect unto you whosoever of you are justified by the law</string>
  <string> ye are fallen from grace</string>
  <string>
 for we through the spirit wait for the hope of righteousness by faith</string>
  <string>
 for in jesus christ neither circumcision availeth any thing nor uncircumcision</string>
  <string> but faith which worketh by love</string>
  <string>
 ye did run well</string>
  <string> who did hinder you that ye should not obey the truth</string>
  <string>
 this persuasion cometh not of him that calleth you</string>
  <string>
 a little leaven leaveneth the whole lump</string>
  <string>
 i have confidence in you through the lord that ye will be none otherwise minded but he that troubleth you shall bear his judgment whosoever he be</string>
  <string>
 i brethren if i yet preach circumcision why do i yet suffer persecution</string>
  <string> then is the offence of the cross ceased</string>
  <string>
 i would they were even cut off which trouble you</string>
  <string>
 for brethren ye have been called unto liberty</string>
  <string> only use not liberty for an occasion to the flesh but by love serve one another</string>
  <string>
 for all the law is fulfilled in one word even in this</string>
  <string> thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself</string>
  <string>
 but if ye bite and devour one another take heed that ye be not consumed one of another</string>
  <string>
 this i say then walk in the spirit and ye shall not fulfil the lust of the flesh</string>
  <string>
 for the flesh lusteth against the spirit and the spirit against the flesh and these are contrary the one to the other so that ye cannot do the things that ye would</string>
  <string>
 but if ye be led of the spirit ye are not under the law</string>
  <string>
 now the works of the flesh are manifest which are these </string>
  <string> adultery fornication uncleanness lasciviousness
 idolatry witchcraft hatred variance emulations wrath strife seditions heresies
 envyings murders drunkenness revellings and such like of the which i tell you before as i have also told you in time past that they which do such things shall not inherit the kingdom of god</string>
  <string>
 but the fruit of the spirit is love joy peace longsuffering gentleness goodness faith
 meekness temperance against such there is no law</string>
  <string>
 they that are christ's have crucified the flesh with the affections and lusts</string>
  <string>
 if we live in the spirit let us also walk in the spirit</string>
  <string>
 let us not be desirous of vain glory provoking one another envying one another</string>
  <string>
 
 brethren if a man be overtaken in a fault ye which are spiritual restore such an one in the spirit of meekness</string>
  <string> considering thyself lest thou also be tempted</string>
  <string>
 bear ye one another's burdens and so fulfil the law of christ</string>
  <string>
 for if a man think himself to be something when he is nothing he deceiveth himself</string>
  <string>
 but let every man prove his own work and then shall he have rejoicing in himself alone and not in another</string>
  <string>
 for every man shall bear his own burden</string>
  <string>
 let him that is taught in the word communicate unto him that teacheth in all good things</string>
  <string>
 be not deceived</string>
  <string> god is not mocked for whatsoever a man soweth that shall he also reap</string>
  <string>
 for he that soweth to his flesh shall of the flesh reap corruption</string>
  <string> but he that soweth to the spirit shall of the spirit reap life everlasting</string>
  <string>
 let us not be weary in well doing for in due season we shall reap if we faint not</string>
  <string>
 as we have therefore opportunity let us do good unto all men especially unto them who are of the household of faith</string>
  <string>
 ye see how large a letter i have written unto you with mine own hand</string>
  <string>
 as many as desire to make a fair shew in the flesh they constrain you to be circumcised</string>
  <string> only lest they should suffer persecution for the cross of christ</string>
  <string>
 for neither they themselves who are circumcised keep the law</string>
  <string> but desire to have you circumcised that they may glory in your flesh</string>
  <string>
 but god forbid that i should glory save in the cross of our lord jesus christ by whom the world is crucified unto me and i unto the world</string>
  <string>
 for in christ jesus neither circumcision availeth any thing nor uncircumcision but a new creature</string>
  <string>
 as many as walk according to this rule peace be on them and mercy and upon the israel of god</string>
  <string>
 from henceforth let no man trouble me for i bear in my body the marks of the lord jesus</string>
  <string>
 brethren the grace of our lord jesus christ be with your spirit</string>
  <string> amen</string>
  <string>
 unto the galatians written from rome</string>
  <string>
 the epistle of paul the apostle to the ephesians
 
 paul an apostle of jesus christ by the will of god to the saints which are at ephesus and to the faithful in christ jesus
 grace be to you and peace from god our father and from the lord jesus christ</string>
  <string>
 blessed be the god and father of our lord jesus christ who hath blessed us with all spiritual blessings in heavenly places in christ
 according as he hath chosen us in him before the foundation of the world that we should be holy and without blame before him in love
 having predestinated us unto the adoption of children by jesus christ to himself according to the good pleasure of his will
 to the praise of the glory of his grace wherein he hath made us accepted in the beloved</string>
  <string>
 in whom we have redemption through his blood the forgiveness of sins according to the riches of his grace</string>
  <string>
 wherein he hath abounded toward us in all wisdom and prudence</string>
  <string>
 having made known unto us the mystery of his will according to his good pleasure which he hath purposed in himself
 that in the dispensation of the fulness of times he might gather together in one all things in christ both which are in heaven and which are on earth</string>
  <string> even in him
 in whom also we have obtained an inheritance being predestinated according to the purpose of him who worketh all things after the counsel of his own will
 that we should be to the praise of his glory who first trusted in christ</string>
  <string>
 in whom ye also trusted after that ye heard the word of truth the gospel of your salvation in whom also after that ye believed ye were sealed with that holy spirit of promise
 which is the earnest of our inheritance until the redemption of the purchased possession unto the praise of his glory</string>
  <string>
 wherefore i also after i heard of your faith in the lord jesus and love unto all the saints
 cease not to give thanks for you making mention of you in my prayers</string>
  <string>
 that the god of our lord jesus christ the father of glory may give unto you the spirit of wisdom and revelation in the knowledge of him
 the eyes of your understanding being enlightened</string>
  <string> that ye may know what is the hope of his calling and what the riches of the glory of his inheritance in the saints
 what is the exceeding greatness of his power to us-ward who believe according to the working of his mighty power
 which he wrought in christ when he raised him from the dead and set him at his own right hand in the heavenly places 
 far above all principality and power and might and dominion and every name that is named not only in this world but also in that which is to come
 hath put all things under his feet and gave him to be the head over all things to the church
 which is his body the fulness of him that filleth all in all</string>
  <string>
 
 you hath he quickened who were dead in trespasses and sins</string>
  <string>
 wherein in time past ye walked according to the course of this world according to the prince of the power of the air the spirit that now worketh in the children of disobedience
 among whom also we all had our conversation in times past in the lusts of our flesh fulfilling the desires of the flesh and of the mind</string>
  <string> and were by nature the children of wrath even as others</string>
  <string>
 but god who is rich in mercy for his great love wherewith he loved us
 even when we were dead in sins hath quickened us together with christ by grace ye are saved</string>
  <string>
 hath raised us up together and made us sit together in heavenly places in christ jesus
 that in the ages to come he might shew the exceeding riches of his grace in his kindness toward us through christ jesus</string>
  <string>
 for by grace are ye saved through faith</string>
  <string> and that not of yourselves it is the gift of god
 not of works lest any man should boast</string>
  <string>
 for we are his workmanship created in christ jesus unto good works which god hath before ordained that we should walk in them</string>
  <string>
 wherefore remember that ye being in time past gentiles in the flesh who are called uncircumcision by that which is called the circumcision in the flesh made by hands</string>
  <string>
 that at that time ye were without christ being aliens from the commonwealth of israel and strangers from the covenants of promise having no hope and without god in the world
 but now in christ jesus ye who sometimes were far off are made nigh by the blood of christ</string>
  <string>
 for he is our peace who hath made both one and hath broken down the middle wall of partition between us </string>
  <string>
 having abolished in his flesh the enmity even the law of commandments contained in ordinances</string>
  <string> for to make in himself of twain one new man so making peace</string>
  <string>
 that he might reconcile both unto god in one body by the cross having slain the enmity thereby
 came and preached peace to you which were afar off and to them that were nigh</string>
  <string>
 for through him we both have access by one spirit unto the father</string>
  <string>
 now therefore ye are no more strangers and foreigners but fellowcitizens with the saints and of the household of god</string>
  <string>
 are built upon the foundation of the apostles and prophets jesus christ himself being the chief corner stone </string>
  <string>
 in whom all the building fitly framed together groweth unto an holy temple in the lord
 in whom ye also are builded together for an habitation of god through the spirit</string>
  <string>
 
 for this cause i paul the prisoner of jesus christ for you gentiles
 if ye have heard of the dispensation of the grace of god which is given me to you-ward
 how that by revelation he made known unto me the mystery</string>
  <string> as i wrote afore in few words
 whereby when ye read ye may understand my knowledge in the mystery of christ
 which in other ages was not made known unto the sons of men as it is now revealed unto his holy apostles and prophets by the spirit</string>
  <string>
 that the gentiles should be fellowheirs and of the same body and partakers of his promise in christ by the gospel
 whereof i was made a minister according to the gift of the grace of god given unto me by the effectual working of his power</string>
  <string>
 unto me who am less than the least of all saints is this grace given that i should preach among the gentiles the unsearchable riches of christ</string>
  <string>
 to make all men see what is the fellowship of the mystery which from the beginning of the world hath been hid in god who created all things by jesus christ
 to the intent that now unto the principalities and powers in heavenly places might be known by the church the manifold wisdom of god
 according to the eternal purpose which he purposed in christ jesus our lord
 in whom we have boldness and access with confidence by the faith of him</string>
  <string>
 wherefore i desire that ye faint not at my tribulations for you which is your glory</string>
  <string>
 for this cause i bow my knees unto the father of our lord jesus christ
 of whom the whole family in heaven and earth is named
 that he would grant you according to the riches of his glory to be strengthened with might by his spirit in the inner man</string>
  <string>
 that christ may dwell in your hearts by faith</string>
  <string> that ye being rooted and grounded in love
 may be able to comprehend with all saints what is the breadth and length and depth and height</string>
  <string>
 to know the love of christ which passeth knowledge that ye might be filled with all the fulness of god</string>
  <string>
 now unto him that is able to do exceeding abundantly above all that we ask or think according to the power that worketh in us
 unto him be glory in the church by christ jesus throughout all ages world without end</string>
  <string> amen</string>
  <string>
 
 i therefore the prisoner of the lord beseech you that ye walk worthy of the vocation wherewith ye are called
 with all lowliness and meekness with longsuffering forbearing one another in love</string>
  <string>
 endeavouring to keep the unity of the spirit in the bond of peace</string>
  <string>
 there is one body and one spirit even as ye are called in one hope of your calling</string>
  <string>
 one lord one faith one baptism
 one god and father of all who is above all and through all and in you all</string>
  <string>
 but unto every one of us is given grace according to the measure of the gift of christ</string>
  <string>
 wherefore he saith when he ascended up on high he led captivity captive and gave gifts unto men</string>
  <string>
 now that he ascended what is it but that he also descended first into the lower parts of the earth</string>
  <string>
 he that descended is the same also that ascended up far above all heavens that he might fill all things</string>
  <string>
 he gave some apostles</string>
  <string> and some prophets</string>
  <string> and some evangelists</string>
  <string> and some pastors and teachers</string>
  <string>
 for the perfecting of the saints for the work of the ministry for the edifying of the body of christ
 till we all come in the unity of the faith and of the knowledge of the son of god unto a perfect man unto the measure of the stature of the fulness of christ
 that we henceforth be no more children tossed to and fro and carried about with every wind of doctrine by the sleight of men and cunning craftiness whereby they lie in wait to deceive</string>
  <string>
 but speaking the truth in love may grow up into him in all things which is the head even christ
 from whom the whole body fitly joined together and compacted by that which every joint supplieth according to the effectual working in the measure of every part maketh increase of the body unto the edifying of itself in love</string>
  <string>
 this i say therefore and testify in the lord that ye henceforth walk not as other gentiles walk in the vanity of their mind
 having the understanding darkened being alienated from the life of god through the ignorance that is in them because of the blindness of their heart
 who being past feeling have given themselves over unto lasciviousness to work all uncleanness with greediness</string>
  <string>
 but ye have not so learned christ</string>
  <string>
 if so be that ye have heard him and have been taught by him as the truth is in jesus
 that ye put off concerning the former conversation the old man which is corrupt according to the deceitful lusts</string>
  <string>
 be renewed in the spirit of your mind</string>
  <string>
 that ye put on the new man which after god is created in righteousness and true holiness</string>
  <string>
 wherefore putting away lying speak every man truth with his neighbour for we are members one of another</string>
  <string>
 be ye angry and sin not let not the sun go down upon your wrath
 neither give place to the devil</string>
  <string>
 let him that stole steal no more but rather let him labour working with his hands the thing which is good that he may have to give to him that needeth</string>
  <string>
 let no corrupt communication proceed out of your mouth but that which is good to the use of edifying that it may minister grace unto the hearers</string>
  <string>
 grieve not the holy spirit of god whereby ye are sealed unto the day of redemption</string>
  <string>
 let all bitterness and wrath and anger and clamour and evil speaking be put away from you with all malice
 be ye kind one to another tenderhearted forgiving one another even as god for christ's sake hath forgiven you</string>
  <string>
 
 be ye therefore followers of god as dear children</string>
  <string>
 walk in love as christ also hath loved us and hath given himself for us an offering and a sacrifice to god for a sweetsmelling savour</string>
  <string>
 but fornication and all uncleanness or covetousness let it not be once named among you as becometh saints</string>
  <string>
 neither filthiness nor foolish talking nor jesting which are not convenient but rather giving of thanks</string>
  <string>
 for this ye know that no whoremonger nor unclean person nor covetous man who is an idolater hath any inheritance in the kingdom of christ and of god</string>
  <string>
 let no man deceive you with vain words for because of these things cometh the wrath of god upon the children of disobedience</string>
  <string>
 be not ye therefore partakers with them</string>
  <string>
 for ye were sometimes darkness but now are ye light in the lord walk as children of light
 for the fruit of the spirit is in all goodness and righteousness and truth</string>
  <string>
 proving what is acceptable unto the lord</string>
  <string>
 have no fellowship with the unfruitful works of darkness but rather reprove them </string>
  <string>
 for it is a shame even to speak of those things which are done of them in secret</string>
  <string>
 but all things that are reproved are made manifest by the light for whatsoever doth make manifest is light</string>
  <string>
 wherefore he saith awake thou that sleepest and arise from the dead and christ shall give thee light</string>
  <string>
 see then that ye walk circumspectly not as fools but as wise
 redeeming the time because the days are evil</string>
  <string>
 wherefore be ye not unwise but understanding what the will of the lord is </string>
  <string>
 be not drunk with wine wherein is excess</string>
  <string> but be filled with the spirit</string>
  <string>
 speaking to yourselves in psalms and hymns and spiritual songs singing and making melody in your heart to the lord</string>
  <string>
 giving thanks always for all things unto god and the father in the name of our lord jesus christ</string>
  <string>
 submitting yourselves one to another in the fear of god</string>
  <string>
 wives submit yourselves unto your own husbands as unto the lord</string>
  <string>
 for the husband is the head of the wife even as christ is the head of the church and he is the saviour of the body</string>
  <string>
 therefore as the church is subject unto christ so let the wives be to their own husbands in every thing</string>
  <string>
 husbands love your wives even as christ also loved the church and gave himself for it</string>
  <string>
 that he might sanctify and cleanse it with the washing of water by the word
 that he might present it to himself a glorious church not having spot or wrinkle or any such thing</string>
  <string> but that it should be holy and without blemish</string>
  <string>
 so ought men to love their wives as their own bodies</string>
  <string> he that loveth his wife loveth himself</string>
  <string>
 for no man ever yet hated his own flesh</string>
  <string> but nourisheth and cherisheth it even as the lord the church
 for we are members of his body of his flesh and of his bones</string>
  <string>
 for this cause shall a man leave his father and mother and shall be joined unto his wife and they two shall be one flesh</string>
  <string>
 this is a great mystery but i speak concerning christ and the church</string>
  <string>
 nevertheless let every one of you in particular so love his wife even as himself</string>
  <string> and the wife see that she reverence her husband</string>
  <string>
 
 children obey your parents in the lord for this is right</string>
  <string>
 honour thy father and mother</string>
  <string> which is the first commandment with promise</string>
  <string>
 that it may be well with thee and thou mayest live long on the earth</string>
  <string>
 ye fathers provoke not your children to wrath but bring them up in the nurture and admonition of the lord</string>
  <string>
 servants be obedient to them that are your masters according to the flesh with fear and trembling in singleness of your heart as unto christ</string>
  <string>
 not with eyeservice as menpleasers</string>
  <string> but as the servants of christ doing the will of god from the heart</string>
  <string>
 with good will doing service as to the lord and not to men
 knowing that whatsoever good thing any man doeth the same shall he receive of the lord whether he be bond or free</string>
  <string>
 ye masters do the same things unto them forbearing threatening knowing that your master also is in heaven</string>
  <string> neither is there respect of persons with him</string>
  <string>
 finally my brethren be strong in the lord and in the power of his might</string>
  <string>
 put on the whole armour of god that ye may be able to stand against the wiles of the devil</string>
  <string>
 for we wrestle not against flesh and blood but against principalities against powers against the rulers of the darkness of this world against spiritual wickedness in high places </string>
  <string>
 wherefore take unto you the whole armour of god that ye may be able to withstand in the evil day and having done all to stand</string>
  <string>
 stand therefore having your loins girt about with truth and having on the breastplate of righteousness</string>
  <string>
 your feet shod with the preparation of the gospel of peace</string>
  <string>
 above all taking the shield of faith wherewith ye shall be able to quench all the fiery darts of the wicked</string>
  <string>
 take the helmet of salvation and the sword of the spirit which is the word of god
 praying always with all prayer and supplication in the spirit and watching thereunto with all perseverance and supplication for all saints</string>
  <string>
 for me that utterance may be given unto me that i may open my mouth boldly to make known the mystery of the gospel
 for which i am an ambassador in bonds that therein i may speak boldly as i ought to speak</string>
  <string>
 but that ye also may know my affairs and how i do tychicus a beloved brother and faithful minister in the lord shall make known to you all things
 whom i have sent unto you for the same purpose that ye might know our affairs and that he might comfort your hearts</string>
  <string>
 peace be to the brethren and love with faith from god the father and the lord jesus christ</string>
  <string>
 grace be with all them that love our lord jesus christ in sincerity</string>
  <string> amen</string>
  <string>
 written from rome unto the ephesians by tychicus</string>
  <string>
 the epistle of paul the apostle to the philippians
 
 paul and timotheus the servants of jesus christ to all the saints in christ jesus which are at philippi with the bishops and deacons
 grace be unto you and peace from god our father and from the lord jesus christ</string>
  <string>
 i thank my god upon every remembrance of you
 always in every prayer of mine for you all making request with joy
 for your fellowship in the gospel from the first day until now</string>
  <string>
 being confident of this very thing that he which hath begun a good work in you will perform it until the day of jesus christ
 even as it is meet for me to think this of you all because i have you in my heart</string>
  <string> inasmuch as both in my bonds and in the defence and confirmation of the gospel ye all are partakers of my grace</string>
  <string>
 for god is my record how greatly i long after you all in the bowels of jesus christ</string>
  <string>
 this i pray that your love may abound yet more and more in knowledge and in all judgment</string>
  <string>
 that ye may approve things that are excellent</string>
  <string> that ye may be sincere and without offence till the day of christ</string>
  <string>
 being filled with the fruits of righteousness which are by jesus christ unto the glory and praise of god</string>
  <string>
 but i would ye should understand brethren that the things which happened unto me have fallen out rather unto the furtherance of the gospel</string>
  <string>
 so that my bonds in christ are manifest in all the palace and in all other places </string>
  <string>
 many of the brethren in the lord waxing confident by my bonds are much more bold to speak the word without fear</string>
  <string>
 some indeed preach christ even of envy and strife</string>
  <string> and some also of good will
 the one preach christ of contention not sincerely supposing to add affliction to my bonds
 but the other of love knowing that i am set for the defence of the gospel</string>
  <string>
 what then</string>
  <string> notwithstanding every way whether in pretence or in truth christ is preached</string>
  <string> and i therein do rejoice yea and will rejoice</string>
  <string>
 for i know that this shall turn to my salvation through your prayer and the supply of the spirit of jesus christ
 according to my earnest expectation and my hope that in nothing i shall be ashamed but that with all boldness as always so now also christ shall be magnified in my body whether it be by life or by death</string>
  <string>
 for to me to live is christ and to die is gain</string>
  <string>
 but if i live in the flesh this is the fruit of my labour yet what i shall choose i wot not</string>
  <string>
 for i am in a strait betwixt two having a desire to depart and to be with christ</string>
  <string> which is far better
 nevertheless to abide in the flesh is more needful for you</string>
  <string>
 having this confidence i know that i shall abide and continue with you all for your furtherance and joy of faith</string>
  <string>
 that your rejoicing may be more abundant in jesus christ for me by my coming to you again</string>
  <string>
 only let your conversation be as it becometh the gospel of christ that whether i come and see you or else be absent i may hear of your affairs that ye stand fast in one spirit with one mind striving together for the faith of the gospel</string>
  <string>
 in nothing terrified by your adversaries which is to them an evident token of perdition but to you of salvation and that of god</string>
  <string>
 for unto you it is given in the behalf of christ not only to believe on him but also to suffer for his sake</string>
  <string>
 having the same conflict which ye saw in me and now hear to be in me</string>
  <string>
 
 if there be therefore any consolation in christ if any comfort of love if any fellowship of the spirit if any bowels and mercies
 fulfil ye my joy that ye be likeminded having the same love being of one accord of one mind</string>
  <string>
 let nothing be done through strife or vainglory</string>
  <string> but in lowliness of mind let each esteem other better than themselves</string>
  <string>
 look not every man on his own things but every man also on the things of others</string>
  <string>
 let this mind be in you which was also in christ jesus
 who being in the form of god thought it not robbery to be equal with god
 but made himself of no reputation and took upon him the form of a servant and was made in the likeness of men
 being found in fashion as a man he humbled himself and became obedient unto death even the death of the cross</string>
  <string>
 wherefore god also hath highly exalted him and given him a name which is above every name
 that at the name of jesus every knee should bow of things in heaven and things in earth and things under the earth</string>
  <string>
 that every tongue should confess that jesus christ is lord to the glory of god the father</string>
  <string>
 wherefore my beloved as ye have always obeyed not as in my presence only but now much more in my absence work out your own salvation with fear and trembling</string>
  <string>
 for it is god which worketh in you both to will and to do of his good pleasure</string>
  <string>
 do all things without murmurings and disputings
 that ye may be blameless and harmless the sons of god without rebuke in the midst of a crooked and perverse nation among whom ye shine as lights in the world</string>
  <string>
 holding forth the word of life</string>
  <string> that i may rejoice in the day of christ that i have not run in vain neither laboured in vain</string>
  <string>
 yea and if i be offered upon the sacrifice and service of your faith i joy and rejoice with you all</string>
  <string>
 for the same cause also do ye joy and rejoice with me</string>
  <string>
 but i trust in the lord jesus to send timotheus shortly unto you that i also may be of good comfort when i know your state</string>
  <string>
 for i have no man likeminded who will naturally care for your state</string>
  <string>
 for all seek their own not the things which are jesus christ's</string>
  <string>
 but ye know the proof of him that as a son with the father he hath served with me in the gospel</string>
  <string>
 him therefore i hope to send presently so soon as i shall see how it will go with me</string>
  <string>
 but i trust in the lord that i also myself shall come shortly</string>
  <string>
 yet i supposed it necessary to send to you epaphroditus my brother and companion in labour and fellowsoldier but your messenger and he that ministered to my wants</string>
  <string>
 for he longed after you all and was full of heaviness because that ye had heard that he had been sick</string>
  <string>
 for indeed he was sick nigh unto death but god had mercy on him</string>
  <string> and not on him only but on me also lest i should have sorrow upon sorrow</string>
  <string>
 i sent him therefore the more carefully that when ye see him again ye may rejoice and that i may be the less sorrowful</string>
  <string>
 receive him therefore in the lord with all gladness</string>
  <string> and hold such in reputation
 because for the work of christ he was nigh unto death not regarding his life to supply your lack of service toward me</string>
  <string>
 
 finally my brethren rejoice in the lord</string>
  <string> to write the same things to you to me indeed is not grievous but for you it is safe</string>
  <string>
 beware of dogs beware of evil workers beware of the concision</string>
  <string>
 for we are the circumcision which worship god in the spirit and rejoice in christ jesus and have no confidence in the flesh</string>
  <string>
 though i might also have confidence in the flesh</string>
  <string> if any other man thinketh that he hath whereof he might trust in the flesh i more
 circumcised the eighth day of the stock of israel of the tribe of benjamin an hebrew of the hebrews</string>
  <string> as touching the law a pharisee</string>
  <string>
 concerning zeal persecuting the church</string>
  <string> touching the righteousness which is in the law blameless</string>
  <string>
 but what things were gain to me those i counted loss for christ</string>
  <string>
 yea doubtless and i count all things but loss for the excellency of the knowledge of christ jesus my lord for whom i have suffered the loss of all things and do count them but dung that i may win christ
 be found in him not having mine own righteousness which is of the law but that which is through the faith of christ the righteousness which is of god by faith
 that i may know him and the power of his resurrection and the fellowship of his sufferings being made conformable unto his death</string>
  <string>
 if by any means i might attain unto the resurrection of the dead</string>
  <string>
 not as though i had already attained either were already perfect but i follow after if that i may apprehend that for which also i am apprehended of christ jesus</string>
  <string>
 brethren i count not myself to have apprehended but this one thing i do forgetting those things which are behind and reaching forth unto those things which are before
 i press toward the mark for the prize of the high calling of god in christ jesus</string>
  <string>
 let us therefore as many as be perfect be thus minded and if in any thing ye be otherwise minded god shall reveal even this unto you</string>
  <string>
 nevertheless whereto we have already attained let us walk by the same rule let us mind the same thing</string>
  <string>
 brethren be followers together of me and mark them which walk so as ye have us for an ensample</string>
  <string>
 for many walk of whom i have told you often and now tell you even weeping that they are the enemies of the cross of christ
 whose end is destruction whose god is their belly and whose glory is in their shame who mind earthly things</string>
  <string>
 for our conversation is in heaven</string>
  <string> from whence also we look for the saviour the lord jesus christ
 who shall change our vile body that it may be fashioned like unto his glorious body according to the working whereby he is able even to subdue all things unto himself</string>
  <string>
 
 therefore my brethren dearly beloved and longed for my joy and crown so stand fast in the lord my dearly beloved</string>
  <string>
 i beseech euodias and beseech syntyche that they be of the same mind in the lord</string>
  <string>
 i intreat thee also true yokefellow help those women which laboured with me in the gospel with clement also and with other my fellowlabourers whose names are in the book of life</string>
  <string>
 rejoice in the lord alway and again i say rejoice</string>
  <string>
 let your moderation be known unto all men</string>
  <string> the lord is at hand</string>
  <string>
 be careful for nothing</string>
  <string> but in every thing by prayer and supplication with thanksgiving let your requests be made known unto god</string>
  <string>
 the peace of god which passeth all understanding shall keep your hearts and minds through christ jesus</string>
  <string>
 finally brethren whatsoever things are true whatsoever things are honest whatsoever things are just whatsoever things are pure whatsoever things are lovely whatsoever things are of good report</string>
  <string> if there be any virtue and if there be any praise think on these things</string>
  <string>
 those things which ye have both learned and received and heard and seen in me do and the god of peace shall be with you</string>
  <string>
 but i rejoiced in the lord greatly that now at the last your care of me hath flourished again</string>
  <string> wherein ye were also careful but ye lacked opportunity</string>
  <string>
 not that i speak in respect of want for i have learned in whatsoever state i am therewith to be content</string>
  <string>
 i know both how to be abased and i know how to abound every where and in all things i am instructed both to be full and to be hungry both to abound and to suffer need</string>
  <string>
 i can do all things through christ which strengtheneth me</string>
  <string>
 notwithstanding ye have well done that ye did communicate with my affliction</string>
  <string>
 now ye philippians know also that in the beginning of the gospel when i departed from macedonia no church communicated with me as concerning giving and receiving but ye only</string>
  <string>
 for even in thessalonica ye sent once and again unto my necessity</string>
  <string>
 not because i desire a gift but i desire fruit that may abound to your account</string>
  <string>
 but i have all and abound i am full having received of epaphroditus the things which were sent from you an odour of a sweet smell a sacrifice acceptable wellpleasing to god</string>
  <string>
 but my god shall supply all your need according to his riches in glory by christ jesus</string>
  <string>
 now unto god and our father be glory for ever and ever</string>
  <string> amen</string>
  <string>
 salute every saint in christ jesus</string>
  <string> the brethren which are with me greet you</string>
  <string>
 all the saints salute you chiefly they that are of caesar's household</string>
  <string>
 the grace of our lord jesus christ be with you all</string>
  <string> amen</string>
  <string>
 it was written to the philippians from rome by epaphroditus</string>
  <string>
 the epistle of paul the apostle to the colossians
 
 paul an apostle of jesus christ by the will of god and timotheus our brother
 to the saints and faithful brethren in christ which are at colosse grace be unto you and peace from god our father and the lord jesus christ</string>
  <string>
 we give thanks to god and the father of our lord jesus christ praying always for you
 since we heard of your faith in christ jesus and of the love which ye have to all the saints
 for the hope which is laid up for you in heaven whereof ye heard before in the word of the truth of the gospel</string>
  <string>
 which is come unto you as it is in all the world</string>
  <string> and bringeth forth fruit as it doth also in you since the day ye heard of it and knew the grace of god in truth
 as ye also learned of epaphras our dear fellowservant who is for you a faithful minister of christ</string>
  <string>
 who also declared unto us your love in the spirit</string>
  <string>
 for this cause we also since the day we heard it do not cease to pray for you and to desire that ye might be filled with the knowledge of his will in all wisdom and spiritual understanding</string>
  <string>
 that ye might walk worthy of the lord unto all pleasing being fruitful in every good work and increasing in the knowledge of god</string>
  <string>
 strengthened with all might according to his glorious power unto all patience and longsuffering with joyfulness</string>
  <string>
 giving thanks unto the father which hath made us meet to be partakers of the inheritance of the saints in light
 who hath delivered us from the power of darkness and hath translated us into the kingdom of his dear son
 in whom we have redemption through his blood even the forgiveness of sins
 who is the image of the invisible god the firstborn of every creature
 for by him were all things created that are in heaven and that are in earth visible and invisible whether they be thrones or dominions or principalities or powers all things were created by him and for him
 he is before all things and by him all things consist</string>
  <string>
 he is the head of the body the church who is the beginning the firstborn from the dead</string>
  <string> that in all things he might have the preeminence</string>
  <string>
 for it pleased the father that in him should all fulness dwell</string>
  <string>
 having made peace through the blood of his cross by him to reconcile all things unto himself</string>
  <string> by him i say whether they be things in earth or things in heaven</string>
  <string>
 you that were sometime alienated and enemies in your mind by wicked works yet now hath he reconciled
 in the body of his flesh through death to present you holy and unblameable and unreproveable in his sight
 if ye continue in the faith grounded and settled and be not moved away from the hope of the gospel which ye have heard and which was preached to every creature which is under heaven</string>
  <string> whereof i paul am made a minister</string>
  <string>
 who now rejoice in my sufferings for you and fill up that which is behind of the afflictions of christ in my flesh for his body's sake which is the church
 whereof i am made a minister according to the dispensation of god which is given to me for you to fulfil the word of god</string>
  <string>
 even the mystery which hath been hid from ages and from generations but now is made manifest to his saints
 to whom god would make known what is the riches of the glory of this mystery among the gentiles</string>
  <string> which is christ in you the hope of glory
 whom we preach warning every man and teaching every man in all wisdom</string>
  <string> that we may present every man perfect in christ jesus
 whereunto i also labour striving according to his working which worketh in me mightily</string>
  <string>
 
 for i would that ye knew what great conflict i have for you and for them at laodicea and for as many as have not seen my face in the flesh</string>
  <string>
 that their hearts might be comforted being knit together in love and unto all riches of the full assurance of understanding to the acknowledgement of the mystery of god and of the father and of christ</string>
  <string>
 in whom are hid all the treasures of wisdom and knowledge</string>
  <string>
 this i say lest any man should beguile you with enticing words</string>
  <string>
 for though i be absent in the flesh yet am i with you in the spirit joying and beholding your order and the stedfastness of your faith in christ</string>
  <string>
 as ye have therefore received christ jesus the lord so walk ye in him
 rooted and built up in him and stablished in the faith as ye have been taught abounding therein with thanksgiving</string>
  <string>
 beware lest any man spoil you through philosophy and vain deceit after the tradition of men after the rudiments of the world and not after christ</string>
  <string>
 for in him dwelleth all the fulness of the godhead bodily</string>
  <string>
 ye are complete in him which is the head of all principality and power
 in whom also ye are circumcised with the circumcision made without hands in putting off the body of the sins of the flesh by the circumcision of christ
 buried with him in baptism wherein also ye are risen with him through the faith of the operation of god who hath raised him from the dead</string>
  <string>
 you being dead in your sins and the uncircumcision of your flesh hath he quickened together with him having forgiven you all trespasses</string>
  <string>
 blotting out the handwriting of ordinances that was against us which was contrary to us and took it out of the way nailing it to his cross</string>
  <string>
 having spoiled principalities and powers he made a shew of them openly triumphing over them in it</string>
  <string>
 let no man therefore judge you in meat or in drink or in respect of an holyday or of the new moon or of the sabbath days 
 which are a shadow of things to come</string>
  <string> but the body is of christ</string>
  <string>
 let no man beguile you of your reward in a voluntary humility and worshipping of angels intruding into those things which he hath not seen vainly puffed up by his fleshly mind
 not holding the head from which all the body by joints and bands having nourishment ministered and knit together increaseth with the increase of god</string>
  <string>
 wherefore if ye be dead with christ from the rudiments of the world why as though living in the world are ye subject to ordinances
 touch not</string>
  <string> taste not</string>
  <string> handle not</string>
  <string>
 which all are to perish with the using</string>
  <string> after the commandments and doctrines of men</string>
  <string>
 which things have indeed a shew of wisdom in will worship and humility and neglecting of the body</string>
  <string> not in any honour to the satisfying of the flesh</string>
  <string>
 
 if ye then be risen with christ seek those things which are above where christ sitteth on the right hand of god</string>
  <string>
 set your affection on things above not on things on the earth</string>
  <string>
 for ye are dead and your life is hid with christ in god</string>
  <string>
 when christ who is our life shall appear then shall ye also appear with him in glory</string>
  <string>
 mortify therefore your members which are upon the earth</string>
  <string> fornication uncleanness inordinate affection evil concupiscence and covetousness which is idolatry
 for which things' sake the wrath of god cometh on the children of disobedience
 in the which ye also walked some time when ye lived in them</string>
  <string>
 but now ye also put off all these</string>
  <string> anger wrath malice blasphemy filthy communication out of your mouth</string>
  <string>
 lie not one to another seeing that ye have put off the old man with his deeds</string>

  <string> amen</string>
  <string>
 written from rome to the colossians by tychicus and onesimus</string>
  <string>
 the first epistle of paul the apostle to the thessalonians
 
 paul and silvanus and timotheus unto the church of the thessalonians which is in god the father and in the lord jesus christ grace be unto you and peace from god our father and the lord jesus christ</string>
  <string>
 we give thanks to god always for you all making mention of you in our prayers</string>
  <string>
 remembering without ceasing your work of faith and labour of love and patience of hope in our lord jesus christ in the sight of god and our father</string>
  <string>
 knowing brethren beloved your election of god</string>
  <string>
 for our gospel came not unto you in word only but also in power and in the holy ghost and in much assurance</string>
  <string> as ye know what manner of men we were among you for your sake</string>
  <string>
 ye became followers of us and of the lord having received the word in much affliction with joy of the holy ghost
 so that ye were ensamples to all that believe in macedonia and achaia</string>
  <string>
 for from you sounded out the word of the lord not only in macedonia and achaia but also in every place your faith to god-ward is spread abroad</string>
  <string> so that we need not to speak any thing</string>
  <string>
 for they themselves shew of us what manner of entering in we had unto you and how ye turned to god from idols to serve the living and true god</string>
  <string>
 to wait for his son from heaven whom he raised from the dead even jesus which delivered us from the wrath to come</string>
  <string>
 
 for yourselves brethren know our entrance in unto you that it was not in vain
 but even after that we had suffered before and were shamefully entreated as ye know at philippi we were bold in our god to speak unto you the gospel of god with much contention</string>
  <string>
 for our exhortation was not of deceit nor of uncleanness nor in guile
 but as we were allowed of god to be put in trust with the gospel even so we speak</string>
  <string> not as pleasing men but god which trieth our hearts</string>
  <string>
 for neither at any time used we flattering words as ye know nor a cloke of covetousness</string>
  <string> god is witness
 nor of men sought we glory neither of you nor yet of others when we might have been burdensome as the apostles of christ</string>
  <string>
 but we were gentle among you even as a nurse cherisheth her children
 so being affectionately desirous of you we were willing to have imparted unto you not the gospel of god only but also our own souls because ye were dear unto us</string>
  <string>
 for ye remember brethren our labour and travail for labouring night and day because we would not be chargeable unto any of you we preached unto you the gospel of god</string>
  <string>
 ye are witnesses and god also how holily and justly and unblameably we behaved ourselves among you that believe
 as ye know how we exhorted and comforted and charged every one of you as a father doth his children
 that ye would walk worthy of god who hath called you unto his kingdom and glory</string>
  <string>
 for this cause also thank we god without ceasing because when ye received the word of god which ye heard of us ye received it not as the word of men but as it is in truth the word of god which effectually worketh also in you that believe</string>
  <string>
 for ye brethren became followers of the churches of god which in judaea are in christ jesus for ye also have suffered like things of your own countrymen even as they have of the jews
 who both killed the lord jesus and their own prophets and have persecuted us</string>
  <string> and they please not god and are contrary to all men
 forbidding us to speak to the gentiles that they might be saved to fill up their sins alway for the wrath is come upon them to the uttermost</string>
  <string>
 but we brethren being taken from you for a short time in presence not in heart endeavoured the more abundantly to see your face with great desire</string>
  <string>
 wherefore we would have come unto you even i paul once and again</string>
  <string> but satan hindered us</string>
  <string>
 for what is our hope or joy or crown of rejoicing</string>
  <string> are not even ye in the presence of our lord jesus christ at his coming</string>
  <string>
 for ye are our glory and joy</string>
  <string>
 
 wherefore when we could no longer forbear we thought it good to be left at athens alone</string>
  <string>
 sent timotheus our brother and minister of god and our fellowlabourer in the gospel of christ to establish you and to comfort you concerning your faith
 that no man should be moved by these afflictions for yourselves know that we are appointed thereunto</string>
  <string>
 for verily when we were with you we told you before that we should suffer tribulation</string>
  <string> even as it came to pass and ye know</string>
  <string>
 for this cause when i could no longer forbear i sent to know your faith lest by some means the tempter have tempted you and our labour be in vain</string>
  <string>
 but now when timotheus came from you unto us and brought us good tidings of your faith and charity and that ye have good remembrance of us always desiring greatly to see us as we also to see you
 therefore brethren we were comforted over you in all our affliction and distress by your faith
 for now we live if ye stand fast in the lord</string>
  <string>
 for what thanks can we render to god again for you for all the joy wherewith we joy for your sakes before our god</string>
  <string>
 night and day praying exceedingly that we might see your face and might perfect that which is lacking in your faith</string>
  <string>
 now god himself and our father and our lord jesus christ direct our way unto you</string>
  <string>
 the lord make you to increase and abound in love one toward another and toward all men even as we do toward you
 to the end he may stablish your hearts unblameable in holiness before god even our father at the coming of our lord jesus christ with all his saints</string>
  <string>
 
 furthermore then we beseech you brethren and exhort you by the lord jesus that as ye have received of us how ye ought to walk and to please god so ye would abound more and more</string>
  <string>
 for ye know what commandments we gave you by the lord jesus</string>
  <string>
 for this is the will of god even your sanctification that ye should abstain from fornication
 that every one of you should know how to possess his vessel in sanctification and honour</string>
  <string>
 not in the lust of concupiscence even as the gentiles which know not god
 that no man go beyond and defraud his brother in any matter because that the lord is the avenger of all such as we also have forewarned you and testified</string>
  <string>
 for god hath not called us unto uncleanness but unto holiness</string>
  <string>
 he therefore that despiseth despiseth not man but god who hath also given unto us his holy spirit</string>
  <string>
 but as touching brotherly love ye need not that i write unto you for ye yourselves are taught of god to love one another</string>
  <string>
 indeed ye do it toward all the brethren which are in all macedonia but we beseech you brethren that ye increase more and more</string>
  <string>
 that ye study to be quiet and to do your own business and to work with your own hands as we commanded you</string>
  <string>
 that ye may walk honestly toward them that are without and that ye may have lack of nothing</string>
  <string>
 but i would not have you to be ignorant brethren concerning them which are asleep that ye sorrow not even as others which have no hope</string>
  <string>
 for if we believe that jesus died and rose again even so them also which sleep in jesus will god bring with him</string>
  <string>
 for this we say unto you by the word of the lord that we which are alive and remain unto the coming of the lord shall not prevent them which are asleep</string>
  <string>
 for the lord himself shall descend from heaven with a shout with the voice of the archangel and with the trump of god and the dead in christ shall rise first
 then we which are alive and remain shall be caught up together with them in the clouds to meet the lord in the air and so shall we ever be with the lord</string>
  <string>
 wherefore comfort one another with these words</string>
  <string>
 
 but of the times and the seasons brethren ye have no need that i write unto you</string>
  <string>
 for yourselves know perfectly that the day of the lord so cometh as a thief in the night</string>
  <string>
 for when they shall say peace and safety</string>
  <string> then sudden destruction cometh upon them as travail upon a woman with child</string>
  <string> and they shall not escape</string>
  <string>
 but ye brethren are not in darkness that that day should overtake you as a thief</string>
  <string>
 ye are all the children of light and the children of the day we are not of the night nor of darkness</string>
  <string>
 therefore let us not sleep as do others</string>
  <string> but let us watch and be sober</string>
  <string>
 for they that sleep sleep in the night</string>
  <string> and they that be drunken are drunken in the night</string>
  <string>
 but let us who are of the day be sober putting on the breastplate of faith and love</string>
  <string> and for an helmet the hope of salvation</string>
  <string>
 for god hath not appointed us to wrath but to obtain salvation by our lord jesus christ
 who died for us that whether we wake or sleep we should live together with him</string>
  <string>
 wherefore comfort yourselves together and edify one another even as also ye do</string>
  <string>
 we beseech you brethren to know them which labour among you and are over you in the lord and admonish you</string>
  <string>
 to esteem them very highly in love for their work's sake</string>
  <string> be at peace among yourselves</string>
  <string>
 now we exhort you brethren warn them that are unruly comfort the feebleminded support the weak be patient toward all men </string>
  <string>
 see that none render evil for evil unto any man </string>
  <string> but ever follow that which is good both among yourselves and to all men </string>
  <string>
 rejoice evermore</string>
  <string>
 pray without ceasing</string>
  <string>
 in every thing give thanks for this is the will of god in christ jesus concerning you</string>
  <string>
 quench not the spirit</string>
  <string>
 despise not prophesyings</string>
  <string>
 prove all things</string>
  <string> hold fast that which is good</string>
  <string>
 abstain from all appearance of evil</string>
  <string>
 the very god of peace sanctify you wholly</string>
  <string> and i pray god your whole spirit and soul and body be preserved blameless unto the coming of our lord jesus christ</string>
  <string>
 faithful is he that calleth you who also will do it </string>
  <string>
 brethren pray for us</string>
  <string>
 greet all the brethren with an holy kiss</string>
  <string>
 i charge you by the lord that this epistle be read unto all the holy brethren</string>
  <string>
 the grace of our lord jesus christ be with you</string>
  <string> amen</string>
  <string>
 the first epistle unto the thessalonians was written from athens</string>
  <string>
 the second epistle of paul the apostle to the thessalonians
 
 paul and silvanus and timotheus unto the church of the thessalonians in god our father and the lord jesus christ
 grace unto you and peace from god our father and the lord jesus christ</string>
  <string>
 we are bound to thank god always for you brethren as it is meet because that your faith groweth exceedingly and the charity of every one of you all toward each other aboundeth</string>
  <string>
 so that we ourselves glory in you in the churches of god for your patience and faith in all your persecutions and tribulations that ye endure
 which is a manifest token of the righteous judgment of god that ye may be counted worthy of the kingdom of god for which ye also suffer
 seeing it is a righteous thing with god to recompense tribulation to them that trouble you</string>
  <string>
 to you who are troubled rest with us when the lord jesus shall be revealed from heaven with his mighty angels
 in flaming fire taking vengeance on them that know not god and that obey not the gospel of our lord jesus christ
 who shall be punished with everlasting destruction from the presence of the lord and from the glory of his power</string>
  <string>
 when he shall come to be glorified in his saints and to be admired in all them that believe because our testimony among you was believed in that day</string>
  <string>
 wherefore also we pray always for you that our god would count you worthy of this calling and fulfil all the good pleasure of his goodness and the work of faith with power
 that the name of our lord jesus christ may be glorified in you and ye in him according to the grace of our god and the lord jesus christ</string>
  <string>
 
 now we beseech you brethren by the coming of our lord jesus christ and by our gathering together unto him
 that ye be not soon shaken in mind or be troubled neither by spirit nor by word nor by letter as from us as that the day of christ is at hand</string>
  <string>
 let no man deceive you by any means for that day shall not come except there come a falling away first and that man of sin be revealed the son of perdition</string>
  <string>
 who opposeth and exalteth himself above all that is called god or that is worshipped</string>
  <string> so that he as god sitteth in the temple of god shewing himself that he is god</string>
  <string>
 remember ye not that when i was yet with you i told you these things</string>
  <string>
 now ye know what withholdeth that he might be revealed in his time</string>
  <string>
 for the mystery of iniquity doth already work only he who now letteth will let until he be taken out of the way</string>
  <string>
 then shall that wicked be revealed whom the lord shall consume with the spirit of his mouth and shall destroy with the brightness of his coming
 even him whose coming is after the working of satan with all power and signs and lying wonders
 with all deceivableness of unrighteousness in them that perish</string>
  <string> because they received not the love of the truth that they might be saved</string>
  <string>
 for this cause god shall send them strong delusion that they should believe a lie
 that they all might be damned who believed not the truth but had pleasure in unrighteousness</string>
  <string>
 but we are bound to give thanks alway to god for you brethren beloved of the lord because god hath from the beginning chosen you to salvation through sanctification of the spirit and belief of the truth
 whereunto he called you by our gospel to the obtaining of the glory of our lord jesus christ</string>
  <string>
 therefore brethren stand fast and hold the traditions which ye have been taught whether by word or our epistle</string>
  <string>
 now our lord jesus christ himself and god even our father which hath loved us and hath given us everlasting consolation and good hope through grace
 comfort your hearts and stablish you in every good word and work</string>
  <string>
 
 finally brethren pray for us that the word of the lord may have free course and be glorified even as it is with you
 that we may be delivered from unreasonable and wicked men for all men have not faith</string>
  <string>
 but the lord is faithful who shall stablish you and keep you from evil</string>
  <string>
 we have confidence in the lord touching you that ye both do and will do the things which we command you</string>
  <string>
 the lord direct your hearts into the love of god and into the patient waiting for christ</string>
  <string>
 now we command you brethren in the name of our lord jesus christ that ye withdraw yourselves from every brother that walketh disorderly and not after the tradition which he received of us</string>
  <string>
 for yourselves know how ye ought to follow us for we behaved not ourselves disorderly among you</string>
  <string>
 neither did we eat any man's bread for nought</string>
  <string> but wrought with labour and travail night and day that we might not be chargeable to any of you
 not because we have not power but to make ourselves an ensample unto you to follow us</string>
  <string>
 for even when we were with you this we commanded you that if any would not work neither should he eat</string>
  <string>
 for we hear that there are some which walk among you disorderly working not at all but are busybodies</string>
  <string>
 now them that are such we command and exhort by our lord jesus christ that with quietness they work and eat their own bread</string>
  <string>
 but ye brethren be not weary in well doing</string>
  <string>
 if any man obey not our word by this epistle note that man and have no company with him that he may be ashamed</string>
  <string>
 yet count him not as an enemy but admonish him as a brother</string>
  <string>
 now the lord of peace himself give you peace always by all means</string>
  <string> the lord be with you all</string>
  <string>
 the salutation of paul with mine own hand which is the token in every epistle so i write</string>
  <string>
 the grace of our lord jesus christ be with you all</string>
  <string> amen</string>
  <string>
 the second epistle to the thessalonians was written from athens</string>
  <string>
 the first epistle of paul the apostle to timothy
 
 paul an apostle of jesus christ by the commandment of god our saviour and lord jesus christ which is our hope</string>
  <string>
 unto timothy my own son in the faith grace mercy and peace from god our father and jesus christ our lord</string>
  <string>
 as i besought thee to abide still at ephesus when i went into macedonia that thou mightest charge some that they teach no other doctrine
 neither give heed to fables and endless genealogies which minister questions rather than godly edifying which is in faith so do </string>
  <string>
 now the end of the commandment is charity out of a pure heart and of a good conscience and of faith unfeigned
 from which some having swerved have turned aside unto vain jangling</string>
  <string>
 desiring to be teachers of the law</string>
  <string> understanding neither what they say nor whereof they affirm</string>
  <string>
 but we know that the law is good if a man use it lawfully</string>
  <string>
 knowing this that the law is not made for a righteous man but for the lawless and disobedient for the ungodly and for sinners for unholy and profane for murderers of fathers and murderers of mothers for manslayers
 for whoremongers for them that defile themselves with mankind for menstealers for liars for perjured persons and if there be any other thing that is contrary to sound doctrine</string>
  <string>
 according to the glorious gospel of the blessed god which was committed to my trust</string>
  <string>
 i thank christ jesus our lord who hath enabled me for that he counted me faithful putting me into the ministry</string>
  <string>
 who was before a blasphemer and a persecutor and injurious but i obtained mercy because i did it ignorantly in unbelief</string>
  <string>
 the grace of our lord was exceeding abundant with faith and love which is in christ jesus</string>
  <string>
 this is a faithful saying and worthy of all acceptation that christ jesus came into the world to save sinners</string>
  <string> of whom i am chief</string>
  <string>
 howbeit for this cause i obtained mercy that in me first jesus christ might shew forth all longsuffering for a pattern to them which should hereafter believe on him to life everlasting</string>
  <string>
 now unto the king eternal immortal invisible the only wise god be honour and glory for ever and ever</string>
  <string> amen</string>
  <string>
 this charge i commit unto thee son timothy according to the prophecies which went before on thee that thou by them mightest war a good warfare</string>
  <string>
 holding faith and a good conscience</string>
  <string> which some having put away concerning faith have made shipwreck
 of whom is hymenaeus and alexander</string>
  <string> whom i have delivered unto satan that they may learn not to blaspheme</string>
  <string>
 
 i exhort therefore that first of all supplications prayers intercessions and giving of thanks be made for all men</string>
  <string>
 for kings and for all that are in authority</string>
  <string> that we may lead a quiet and peaceable life in all godliness and honesty</string>
  <string>
 for this is good and acceptable in the sight of god our saviour</string>
  <string>
 who will have all men to be saved and to come unto the knowledge of the truth</string>
  <string>
 for there is one god and one mediator between god and men the man christ jesus</string>
  <string>
 who gave himself a ransom for all to be testified in due time</string>
  <string>
 whereunto i am ordained a preacher and an apostle i speak the truth in christ and lie not</string>
  <string> a teacher of the gentiles in faith and verity</string>
  <string>
 i will therefore that men pray every where lifting up holy hands without wrath and doubting</string>
  <string>
 in like manner also that women adorn themselves in modest apparel with shamefacedness and sobriety</string>
  <string> not with broided hair or gold or pearls or costly array</string>
  <string>
 but which becometh women professing godliness with good works</string>
  <string>
 let the woman learn in silence with all subjection</string>
  <string>
 but i suffer not a woman to teach nor to usurp authority over the man but to be in silence</string>
  <string>
 for adam was first formed then eve</string>
  <string>
 adam was not deceived but the woman being deceived was in the transgression</string>
  <string>
 notwithstanding she shall be saved in childbearing if they continue in faith and charity and holiness with sobriety</string>
  <string>
 
 this is a true saying if a man desire the office of a bishop he desireth a good work</string>
  <string>
 a bishop then must be blameless the husband of one wife vigilant sober of good behaviour given to hospitality apt to teach</string>
  <string>
 not given to wine no striker not greedy of filthy lucre</string>
  <string> but patient not a brawler not covetous</string>
  <string>
 one that ruleth well his own house having his children in subjection with all gravity</string>
  <string>
 for if a man know not how to rule his own house how shall he take care of the church of god</string>
  <string>
 not a novice lest being lifted up with pride he fall into the condemnation of the devil</string>
  <string>
 moreover he must have a good report of them which are without</string>
  <string> lest he fall into reproach and the snare of the devil</string>
  <string>
 likewise must the deacons be grave not doubletongued not given to much wine not greedy of filthy lucre</string>
  <string>
 holding the mystery of the faith in a pure conscience</string>
  <string>
 let these also first be proved</string>
  <string> then let them use the office of a deacon being found blameless</string>
  <string>
 even so must their wives be grave not slanderers sober faithful in all things</string>
  <string>
 let the deacons be the husbands of one wife ruling their children and their own houses well</string>
  <string>
 for they that have used the office of a deacon well purchase to themselves a good degree and great boldness in the faith which is in christ jesus</string>
  <string>
 these things write i unto thee hoping to come unto thee shortly
 but if i tarry long that thou mayest know how thou oughtest to behave thyself in the house of god which is the church of the living god the pillar and ground of the truth</string>
  <string>
 without controversy great is the mystery of godliness god was manifest in the flesh justified in the spirit seen of angels preached unto the gentiles believed on in the world received up into glory</string>
  <string>
 
 now the spirit speaketh expressly that in the latter times some shall depart from the faith giving heed to seducing spirits and doctrines of devils</string>
  <string>
 speaking lies in hypocrisy</string>
  <string> having their conscience seared with a hot iron</string>
  <string>
 forbidding to marry and commanding to abstain from meats which god hath created to be received with thanksgiving of them which believe and know the truth</string>
  <string>
 for every creature of god is good and nothing to be refused if it be received with thanksgiving
 for it is sanctified by the word of god and prayer</string>
  <string>
 if thou put the brethren in remembrance of these things thou shalt be a good minister of jesus christ nourished up in the words of faith and of good doctrine whereunto thou hast attained</string>
  <string>
 but refuse profane and old wives' fables and exercise thyself rather unto godliness</string>
  <string>
 for bodily exercise profiteth little but godliness is profitable unto all things having promise of the life that now is and of that which is to come</string>
  <string>
 this is a faithful saying and worthy of all acceptation</string>
  <string>
 for therefore we both labour and suffer reproach because we trust in the living god who is the saviour of all men specially of those that believe</string>
  <string>
 these things command and teach</string>
  <string>
 let no man despise thy youth</string>
  <string> but be thou an example of the believers in word in conversation in charity in spirit in faith in purity</string>
  <string>
 till i come give attendance to reading to exhortation to doctrine</string>
  <string>
 neglect not the gift that is in thee which was given thee by prophecy with the laying on of the hands of the presbytery</string>
  <string>
 meditate upon these things</string>
  <string> give thyself wholly to them</string>
  <string> that thy profiting may appear to all</string>
  <string>
 take heed unto thyself and unto the doctrine</string>
  <string> continue in them for in doing this thou shalt both save thyself and them that hear thee</string>
  <string>
 
 rebuke not an elder but intreat him as a father</string>
  <string> and the younger men as brethren</string>
  <string>
 the elder women as mothers</string>
  <string> the younger as sisters with all purity</string>
  <string>
 honour widows that are widows indeed</string>
  <string>
 but if any widow have children or nephews let them learn first to shew piety at home and to requite their parents for that is good and acceptable before god</string>
  <string>
 now she that is a widow indeed and desolate trusteth in god and continueth in supplications and prayers night and day</string>
  <string>
 but she that liveth in pleasure is dead while she liveth</string>
  <string>
 these things give in charge that they may be blameless</string>
  <string>
 but if any provide not for his own and specially for those of his own house he hath denied the faith and is worse than an infidel</string>

 let not a widow be taken into the number under threescore years old having been the wife of one man
 well reported of for good works</string>
  <string> if she have brought up children if she have lodged strangers if she have washed the saints' feet if she have relieved the afflicted if she have diligently followed every good work</string>
  <string>
 but the younger widows refuse for when they have begun to wax wanton against christ they will marry</string>
  <string>
 having damnation because they have cast off their first faith</string>
  <string>
 withal they learn to be idle wandering about from house to house</string>
  <string> and not only idle but tattlers also and busybodies speaking things which they ought not</string>
  <string>
 i will therefore that the younger women marry bear children guide the house give none occasion to the adversary to speak reproachfully</string>
  <string>
 for some are already turned aside after satan</string>
  <string>
 if any man or woman that believeth have widows let them relieve them and let not the church be charged</string>
  <string> that it may relieve them that are widows indeed</string>
  <string>
 let the elders that rule well be counted worthy of double honour especially they who labour in the word and doctrine</string>
  <string>
 for the scripture saith thou shalt not muzzle the ox that treadeth out the corn</string>
  <string> the labourer is worthy of his reward</string>
  <string>
 against an elder receive not an accusation but before two or three witnesses</string>
  <string>
 them that sin rebuke before all that others also may fear</string>
  <string>
 i charge thee before god and the lord jesus christ and the elect angels that thou observe these things without preferring one before another doing nothing by partiality</string>
  <string>
 lay hands suddenly on no man neither be partaker of other men's sins keep thyself pure</string>
  <string>
 drink no longer water but use a little wine for thy stomach's sake and thine often infirmities</string>
  <string>
 some men's sins are open beforehand going before to judgment</string>
  <string> and some men they follow after</string>
  <string>
 likewise also the good works of some are manifest beforehand</string>
  <string> and they that are otherwise cannot be hid</string>
  <string>
 
 let as many servants as are under the yoke count their own masters worthy of all honour that the name of god and his doctrine be not blasphemed</string>
  <string>
 they that have believing masters let them not despise them because they are brethren</string>
  <string> but rather do them service because they are faithful and beloved partakers of the benefit</string>
  <string> these things teach and exhort</string>
  <string>
 if any man teach otherwise and consent not to wholesome words even the words of our lord jesus christ and to the doctrine which is according to godliness</string>
  <string>
 he is proud knowing nothing but doting about questions and strifes of words whereof cometh envy strife railings evil surmisings
 perverse disputings of men of corrupt minds and destitute of the truth supposing that gain is godliness from such withdraw thyself</string>
  <string>
 but godliness with contentment is great gain</string>
  <string>
 for we brought nothing into this world and it is certain we can carry nothing out</string>
  <string>
 having food and raiment let us be therewith content</string>
  <string>
 but they that will be rich fall into temptation and a snare and into many foolish and hurtful lusts which drown men in destruction and perdition</string>
  <string>
 for the love of money is the root of all evil which while some coveted after they have erred from the faith and pierced themselves through with many sorrows</string>
  <string>
 but thou o man of god flee these things</string>
  <string> and follow after righteousness godliness faith love patience meekness</string>
  <string>
 fight the good fight of faith lay hold on eternal life whereunto thou art also called and hast professed a good profession before many witnesses</string>
  <string>
 i give thee charge in the sight of god who quickeneth all things and before christ jesus who before pontius pilate witnessed a good confession</string>
  <string>
 that thou keep this commandment without spot unrebukeable until the appearing of our lord jesus christ
 which in his times he shall shew who is the blessed and only potentate the king of kings and lord of lords</string>
  <string>
 who only hath immortality dwelling in the light which no man can approach unto</string>
  <string> whom no man hath seen nor can see to whom be honour and power everlasting</string>
  <string> amen</string>
  <string>
 charge them that are rich in this world that they be not highminded nor trust in uncertain riches but in the living god who giveth us richly all things to enjoy</string>
  <string>
 that they do good that they be rich in good works ready to distribute willing to communicate</string>
  <string>
 laying up in store for themselves a good foundation against the time to come that they may lay hold on eternal life</string>
  <string>
 o timothy keep that which is committed to thy trust avoiding profane and vain babblings and oppositions of science falsely so called
 which some professing have erred concerning the faith</string>
  <string> grace be with thee</string>
  <string> amen</string>
  <string>
 the first to timothy was written from laodicea which is the chiefest city of phrygia pacatiana</string>
  <string>
 the second epistle of paul the apostle to timothy
 
 paul an apostle of jesus christ by the will of god according to the promise of life which is in christ jesus
 to timothy my dearly beloved son grace mercy and peace from god the father and christ jesus our lord</string>
  <string>
 i thank god whom i serve from my forefathers with pure conscience that without ceasing i have remembrance of thee in my prayers night and day</string>
  <string>
 greatly desiring to see thee being mindful of thy tears that i may be filled with joy</string>
  <string>
 when i call to remembrance the unfeigned faith that is in thee which dwelt first in thy grandmother lois and thy mother eunice</string>
  <string> and i am persuaded that in thee also</string>
  <string>
 wherefore i put thee in remembrance that thou stir up the gift of god which is in thee by the putting on of my hands</string>
  <string>
 for god hath not given us the spirit of fear</string>
  <string> but of power and of love and of a sound mind</string>
  <string>
 be not thou therefore ashamed of the testimony of our lord nor of me his prisoner but be thou partaker of the afflictions of the gospel according to the power of god</string>
  <string>
 who hath saved us and called us with an holy calling not according to our works but according to his own purpose and grace which was given us in christ jesus before the world began
 but is now made manifest by the appearing of our saviour jesus christ who hath abolished death and hath brought life and immortality to light through the gospel
 whereunto i am appointed a preacher and an apostle and a teacher of the gentiles</string>
  <string>
 for the which cause i also suffer these things nevertheless i am not ashamed for i know whom i have believed and am persuaded that he is able to keep that which i have committed unto him against that day</string>
  <string>
 hold fast the form of sound words which thou hast heard of me in faith and love which is in christ jesus</string>
  <string>
 that good thing which was committed unto thee keep by the holy ghost which dwelleth in us</string>
  <string>
 this thou knowest that all they which are in asia be turned away from me</string>
  <string> of whom are phygellus and hermogenes</string>
  <string>
 the lord give mercy unto the house of onesiphorus</string>
  <string> for he oft refreshed me and was not ashamed of my chain
 but when he was in rome he sought me out very diligently and found me </string>
  <string>
 the lord grant unto him that he may find mercy of the lord in that day and in how many things he ministered unto me at ephesus thou knowest very well</string>
  <string>
 
 thou therefore my son be strong in the grace that is in christ jesus</string>
  <string>
 the things that thou hast heard of me among many witnesses the same commit thou to faithful men who shall be able to teach others also</string>
  <string>
 thou therefore endure hardness as a good soldier of jesus christ</string>
  <string>
 no man that warreth entangleth himself with the affairs of this life</string>
  <string> that he may please him who hath chosen him to be a soldier</string>
  <string>
 if a man also strive for masteries yet is he not crowned except he strive lawfully</string>
  <string>
 the husbandman that laboureth must be first partaker of the fruits</string>
  <string>
 consider what i say</string>
  <string> and the lord give thee understanding in all things</string>
  <string>
 remember that jesus christ of the seed of david was raised from the dead according to my gospel
 wherein i suffer trouble as an evil doer even unto bonds</string>
  <string> but the word of god is not bound</string>
  <string>
 therefore i endure all things for the elect's sakes that they may also obtain the salvation which is in christ jesus with eternal glory</string>
  <string>
 it is a faithful saying for if we be dead with him we shall also live with him 
 if we suffer we shall also reign with him  if we deny him he also will deny us
 if we believe not yet he abideth faithful he cannot deny himself</string>
  <string>
 of these things put them in remembrance charging them before the lord that they strive not about words to no profit but to the subverting of the hearers</string>
  <string>
 study to shew thyself approved unto god a workman that needeth not to be ashamed rightly dividing the word of truth</string>
  <string>
 but shun profane and vain babblings for they will increase unto more ungodliness</string>
  <string>
 their word will eat as doth a canker of whom is hymenaeus and philetus</string>
  <string>
 who concerning the truth have erred saying that the resurrection is past already</string>
  <string> and overthrow the faith of some</string>
  <string>
 nevertheless the foundation of god standeth sure having this seal the lord knoweth them that are his</string>
  <string> let every one that nameth the name of christ depart from iniquity</string>
  <string>
 but in a great house there are not only vessels of gold and of silver but also of wood and of earth</string>
  <string> and some to honour and some to dishonour</string>
  <string>
 if a man therefore purge himself from these he shall be a vessel unto honour sanctified and meet for the master's use and prepared unto every good work</string>
  <string>
 flee also youthful lusts but follow righteousness faith charity peace with them that call on the lord out of a pure heart</string>
  <string>
 but foolish and unlearned questions avoid knowing that they do gender strifes</string>
  <string>
 the servant of the lord must not strive</string>
  <string> but be gentle unto all men apt to teach patient
 in meekness instructing those that oppose themselves</string>
  <string> if god peradventure will give them repentance to the acknowledging of the truth</string>
  <string>
 that they may recover themselves out of the snare of the devil who are taken captive by him at his will</string>
  <string>
 
 this know also that in the last days perilous times shall come</string>
  <string>
 for men shall be lovers of their own selves covetous boasters proud blasphemers disobedient to parents unthankful unholy
 without natural affection trucebreakers false accusers incontinent fierce despisers of those that are good
 traitors heady highminded lovers of pleasures more than lovers of god</string>
  <string>
 having a form of godliness but denying the power thereof from such turn away</string>
  <string>
 for of this sort are they which creep into houses and lead captive silly women laden with sins led away with divers lusts
 ever learning and never able to come to the knowledge of the truth</string>
  <string>
 now as jannes and jambres withstood moses so do these also resist the truth men of corrupt minds reprobate concerning the faith</string>
  <string>
 but they shall proceed no further for their folly shall be manifest unto all men as their's also was</string>
  <string>
 but thou hast fully known my doctrine manner of life purpose faith longsuffering charity patience
 persecutions afflictions which came unto me at antioch at iconium at lystra</string>
  <string> what persecutions i endured but out of them all the lord delivered me</string>
  <string>
 yea and all that will live godly in christ jesus shall suffer persecution</string>
  <string>
 but evil men and seducers shall wax worse and worse deceiving and being deceived</string>
  <string>
 but continue thou in the things which thou hast learned and hast been assured of knowing of whom thou hast learned them </string>
  <string>
 that from a child thou hast known the holy scriptures which are able to make thee wise unto salvation through faith which is in christ jesus</string>
  <string>
 all scripture is given by inspiration of god and is profitable for doctrine for reproof for correction for instruction in righteousness
 that the man of god may be perfect throughly furnished unto all good works</string>
  <string>
 
 i charge thee therefore before god and the lord jesus christ who shall judge the quick and the dead at his appearing and his kingdom</string>
  <string>
 preach the word</string>
  <string> be instant in season out of season</string>
  <string> reprove rebuke exhort with all longsuffering and doctrine</string>
  <string>
 for the time will come when they will not endure sound doctrine</string>
  <string> but after their own lusts shall they heap to themselves teachers having itching ears</string>
  <string>
 they shall turn away their ears from the truth and shall be turned unto fables</string>
  <string>
 but watch thou in all things endure afflictions do the work of an evangelist make full proof of thy ministry</string>
  <string>
 for i am now ready to be offered and the time of my departure is at hand</string>
  <string>
 i have fought a good fight i have finished my course i have kept the faith
 henceforth there is laid up for me a crown of righteousness which the lord the righteous judge shall give me at that day and not to me only but unto all them also that love his appearing</string>
  <string>
 do thy diligence to come shortly unto me
 for demas hath forsaken me having loved this present world and is departed unto thessalonica</string>
  <string> crescens to galatia titus unto dalmatia</string>
  <string>
 only luke is with me</string>
  <string> take mark and bring him with thee for he is profitable to me for the ministry</string>
  <string>
 tychicus have i sent to ephesus</string>
  <string>
 the cloke that i left at troas with carpus when thou comest bring with thee and the books but especially the parchments</string>
  <string>
 alexander the coppersmith did me much evil the lord reward him according to his works
 of whom be thou ware also</string>
  <string> for he hath greatly withstood our words</string>
  <string>
 at my first answer no man stood with me but all men forsook me i pray god that it may not be laid to their charge</string>
  <string>
 notwithstanding the lord stood with me and strengthened me</string>
  <string> that by me the preaching might be fully known and that all the gentiles might hear and i was delivered out of the mouth of the lion</string>
  <string>
 the lord shall deliver me from every evil work and will preserve me unto his heavenly kingdom to whom be glory for ever and ever</string>
  <string> amen</string>
  <string>
 salute prisca and aquila and the household of onesiphorus</string>
  <string>
 erastus abode at corinth but trophimus have i left at miletum sick</string>
  <string>

  <string> eubulus greeteth thee and pudens and linus and claudia and all the brethren</string>

 the lord jesus christ be with thy spirit</string>
  <string> grace be with you</string>
  <string> amen</string>

 the second epistle unto timotheus ordained the first bishop of the church of the ephesians was written from rome when paul was brought before nero the second time</string>
  <string>
 the epistle of paul to titus
 
 paul a servant of god and an apostle of jesus christ according to the faith of god's elect and the acknowledging of the truth which is after godliness</string>
  <string>
 in hope of eternal life which god that cannot lie promised before the world began</string>
  <string>
 but hath in due times manifested his word through preaching which is committed unto me according to the commandment of god our saviour</string>
  <string>
 to titus mine own son after the common faith grace mercy and peace from god the father and the lord jesus christ our saviour</string>
  <string>
 for this cause left i thee in crete that thou shouldest set in order the things that are wanting and ordain elders in every city as i had appointed thee
 if any be blameless the husband of one wife having faithful children not accused of riot or unruly</string>
  <string>
 for a bishop must be blameless as the steward of god</string>
  <string> not selfwilled not soon angry not given to wine no striker not given to filthy lucre</string>
  <string>
 but a lover of hospitality a lover of good men sober just holy temperate</string>
  <string>
 holding fast the faithful word as he hath been taught that he may be able by sound doctrine both to exhort and to convince the gainsayers</string>
  <string>
 for there are many unruly and vain talkers and deceivers specially they of the circumcision
 whose mouths must be stopped who subvert whole houses teaching things which they ought not for filthy lucre's sake</string>
  <string>
 one of themselves even a prophet of their own said the cretians are alway liars evil beasts slow bellies</string>
  <string>
 this witness is true</string>
  <string> wherefore rebuke them sharply that they may be sound in the faith</string>
  <string>
 not giving heed to jewish fables and commandments of men that turn from the truth</string>
  <string>
 unto the pure all things are pure but unto them that are defiled and unbelieving is nothing pure</string>
  <string> but even their mind and conscience is defiled</string>
  <string>
 they profess that they know god</string>
  <string> but in works they deny him being abominable and disobedient and unto every good work reprobate</string>
  <string>
 
 but speak thou the things which become sound doctrine
 that the aged men be sober grave temperate sound in faith in charity in patience</string>
  <string>
 the aged women likewise that they be in behaviour as becometh holiness not false accusers not given to much wine teachers of good things</string>
  <string>
 that they may teach the young women to be sober to love their husbands to love their children
 to be discreet chaste keepers at home good obedient to their own husbands that the word of god be not blasphemed</string>
  <string>
 young men likewise exhort to be sober minded</string>
  <string>
 in all things shewing thyself a pattern of good works in doctrine shewing uncorruptness gravity sincerity
 sound speech that cannot be condemned</string>
  <string> that he that is of the contrary part may be ashamed having no evil thing to say of you</string>
  <string>
 exhort servants to be obedient unto their own masters and to please them well in all things </string>
  <string> not answering again</string>
  <string>
 not purloining but shewing all good fidelity</string>
  <string> that they may adorn the doctrine of god our saviour in all things</string>
  <string>
 for the grace of god that bringeth salvation hath appeared to all men
 teaching us that denying ungodliness and worldly lusts we should live soberly righteously and godly in this present world</string>
  <string>
 looking for that blessed hope and the glorious appearing of the great god and our saviour jesus christ</string>
  <string>
 who gave himself for us that he might redeem us from all iniquity and purify unto himself a peculiar people zealous of good works</string>
  <string>
 these things speak and exhort and rebuke with all authority</string>
  <string> let no man despise thee</string>
  <string>
 
 put them in mind to be subject to principalities and powers to obey magistrates to be ready to every good work
 to speak evil of no man to be no brawlers but gentle shewing all meekness unto all men</string>
  <string>
 for we ourselves also were sometimes foolish disobedient deceived serving divers lusts and pleasures living in malice and envy hateful and hating one another</string>
  <string>
 but after that the kindness and love of god our saviour toward man appeared
 not by works of righteousness which we have done but according to his mercy he saved us by the washing of regeneration and renewing of the holy ghost</string>
  <string>
 which he shed on us abundantly through jesus christ our saviour</string>
  <string>
 that being justified by his grace we should be made heirs according to the hope of eternal life</string>
  <string>
 this is a faithful saying and these things i will that thou affirm constantly that they which have believed in god might be careful to maintain good works</string>
  <string> these things are good and profitable unto men</string>
  <string>
 but avoid foolish questions and genealogies and contentions and strivings about the law</string>
  <string> for they are unprofitable and vain</string>
  <string>
 a man that is an heretick after the first and second admonition reject</string>
  <string>
 knowing that he that is such is subverted and sinneth being condemned of himself</string>
  <string>
 when i shall send artemas unto thee or tychicus be diligent to come unto me to nicopolis for i have determined there to winter</string>
  <string>
 bring zenas the lawyer and apollos on their journey diligently that nothing be wanting unto them</string>
  <string>
 let our's also learn to maintain good works for necessary uses that they be not unfruitful</string>
  <string>
 all that are with me salute thee</string>
  <string> greet them that love us in the faith</string>
  <string> grace be with you all</string>
  <string> amen</string>
  <string>

 the epistle of paul to philemon
 
 paul a prisoner of jesus christ and timothy our brother unto philemon our dearly beloved and fellowlabourer 2 to our beloved apphia and archippus our fellowsoldier and to the church in thy house
 grace to you and peace from god our father and the lord jesus christ</string>
  <string>
 i thank my god making mention of thee always in my prayers
 hearing of thy love and faith which thou hast toward the lord jesus and toward all saints</string>
  <string>
 that the communication of thy faith may become effectual by the acknowledging of every good thing which is in you in christ jesus</string>
  <string>
 for we have great joy and consolation in thy love because the bowels of the saints are refreshed by thee brother</string>
  <string>
 wherefore though i might be much bold in christ to enjoin thee that which is convenient
 yet for love's sake i rather beseech thee being such an one as paul the aged and now also a prisoner of jesus christ</string>
  <string>
 i beseech thee for my son onesimus whom i have begotten in my bonds
 which in time past was to thee unprofitable but now profitable to thee and to me
 whom i have sent again thou therefore receive him that is mine own bowels
 whom i would have retained with me that in thy stead he might have ministered unto me in the bonds of the gospel
 but without thy mind would i do nothing</string>
  <string> that thy benefit should not be as it were of necessity but willingly</string>
  <string>
 for perhaps he therefore departed for a season that thou shouldest receive him for ever</string>
  <string>
 not now as a servant but above a servant a brother beloved specially to me but how much more unto thee both in the flesh and in the lord</string>
  <string>
 if thou count me therefore a partner receive him as myself</string>
  <string>
 if he hath wronged thee or oweth thee ought put that on mine account</string>
  <string>
 i paul have written it with mine own hand i will repay it  albeit i do not say to thee how thou owest unto me even thine own self besides</string>
  <string>
 yea brother let me have joy of thee in the lord refresh my bowels in the lord</string>
  <string>
 having confidence in thy obedience i wrote unto thee knowing that thou wilt also do more than i say</string>
  <string>
 but withal prepare me also a lodging for i trust that through your prayers i shall be given unto you</string>
  <string>
 there salute thee epaphras my fellowprisoner in christ jesus</string>

  <string> amen</string>
  <string>

  <string>
 the epistle of paul the apostle to the hebrews
 
 god who at sundry times and in divers manners spake in time past unto the fathers by the prophets
 hath in these last days spoken unto us by his son whom he hath appointed heir of all things by whom also he made the worlds</string>
  <string>
 who being the brightness of his glory and the express image of his person and upholding all things by the word of his power when he had by himself purged our sins sat down on the right hand of the majesty on high</string>
  <string>
 being made so much better than the angels as he hath by inheritance obtained a more excellent name than they</string>
  <string>
 for unto which of the angels said he at any time thou art my son this day have i begotten thee</string>
  <string> again i will be to him a father and he shall be to me a son</string>
  <string>
 again when he bringeth in the firstbegotten into the world he saith let all the angels of god worship him</string>
  <string>
 of the angels he saith who maketh his angels spirits and his ministers a flame of fire</string>
  <string>
 but unto the son he saith thy throne o god is for ever and ever a sceptre of righteousness is the sceptre of thy kingdom</string>
  <string>
 thou hast loved righteousness and hated iniquity</string>
  <string> therefore god even thy god hath anointed thee with the oil of gladness above thy fellows</string>
  <string>
 thou lord in the beginning hast laid the foundation of the earth</string>
  <string> and the heavens are the works of thine hands
 they shall perish</string>
  <string> but thou remainest</string>
  <string> and they all shall wax old as doth a garment</string>
  <string>
 as a vesture shalt thou fold them up and they shall be changed but thou art the same and thy years shall not fail</string>
  <string>
 but to which of the angels said he at any time sit on my right hand until i make thine enemies thy footstool</string>
  <string>
 are they not all ministering spirits sent forth to minister for them who shall be heirs of salvation</string>
  <string>
 
 therefore we ought to give the more earnest heed to the things which we have heard lest at any time we should let them slip</string>
  <string>
 for if the word spoken by angels was stedfast and every transgression and disobedience received a just recompence of reward</string>
  <string>
 how shall we escape if we neglect so great salvation</string>
  <string> which at the first began to be spoken by the lord and was confirmed unto us by them that heard him </string>
  <string>
 god also bearing them witness both with signs and wonders and with divers miracles and gifts of the holy ghost according to his own will</string>
  <string>
 for unto the angels hath he not put in subjection the world to come whereof we speak</string>
  <string>
 but one in a certain place testified saying what is man that thou art mindful of him</string>
  <string> or the son of man that thou visitest him</string>
  <string>
 thou madest him a little lower than the angels</string>
  <string> thou crownedst him with glory and honour and didst set him over the works of thy hands
 thou hast put all things in subjection under his feet</string>
  <string> for in that he put all in subjection under him he left nothing that is not put under him</string>
  <string> but now we see not yet all things put under him</string>
  <string>
 but we see jesus who was made a little lower than the angels for the suffering of death crowned with glory and honour</string>
  <string> that he by the grace of god should taste death for every man</string>
  <string>
 for it became him for whom are all things and by whom are all things in bringing many sons unto glory to make the captain of their salvation perfect through sufferings</string>
  <string>
 for both he that sanctifieth and they who are sanctified are all of one for which cause he is not ashamed to call them brethren
 saying i will declare thy name unto my brethren in the midst of the church will i sing praise unto thee</string>
  <string>
 again i will put my trust in him</string>
  <string> again behold i and the children which god hath given me</string>
  <string>
 forasmuch then as the children are partakers of flesh and blood he also himself likewise took part of the same</string>
  <string> that through death he might destroy him that had the power of death that is the devil</string>
  <string>
 deliver them who through fear of death were all their lifetime subject to bondage</string>
  <string>
 for verily he took not on him the nature of angels</string>
  <string> but he took on him the seed of abraham</string>
  <string>
 wherefore in all things it behoved him to be made like unto his brethren that he might be a merciful and faithful high priest in things pertaining to god to make reconciliation for the sins of the people</string>
  <string>
 for in that he himself hath suffered being tempted he is able to succour them that are tempted</string>
  <string>
 
 wherefore holy brethren partakers of the heavenly calling consider the apostle and high priest of our profession christ jesus</string>
  <string>
 who was faithful to him that appointed him as also moses was faithful in all his house</string>
  <string>
 for this man was counted worthy of more glory than moses inasmuch as he who hath builded the house hath more honour than the house</string>
  <string>
 for every house is builded by some man </string>
  <string> but he that built all things is god</string>
  <string>
 moses verily was faithful in all his house as a servant for a testimony of those things which were to be spoken after</string>
  <string>
 but christ as a son over his own house</string>
  <string> whose house are we if we hold fast the confidence and the rejoicing of the hope firm unto the end</string>
  <string>
 wherefore as the holy ghost saith to day if ye will hear his voice
 harden not your hearts as in the provocation in the day of temptation in the wilderness
 when your fathers tempted me proved me and saw my works forty years</string>
  <string>
 wherefore i was grieved with that generation and said they do alway err in their heart</string>
  <string> and they have not known my ways</string>
  <string>
 so i sware in my wrath they shall not enter into my rest</string>
  <string>
 take heed brethren lest there be in any of you an evil heart of unbelief in departing from the living god</string>
  <string>
 but exhort one another daily while it is called to day</string>
  <string> lest any of you be hardened through the deceitfulness of sin</string>
  <string>
 for we are made partakers of christ if we hold the beginning of our confidence stedfast unto the end</string>
  <string>
 while it is said to day if ye will hear his voice harden not your hearts as in the provocation</string>
  <string>
 for some when they had heard did provoke howbeit not all that came out of egypt by moses</string>
  <string>
 but with whom was he grieved forty years</string>
  <string> was it not with them that had sinned whose carcases fell in the wilderness</string>
  <string>
 to whom sware he that they should not enter into his rest but to them that believed not</string>
  <string>
 so we see that they could not enter in because of unbelief</string>
  <string>
 
 let us therefore fear lest a promise being left us of entering into his rest any of you should seem to come short of it</string>
  <string>
 for unto us was the gospel preached as well as unto them but the word preached did not profit them not being mixed with faith in them that heard it </string>
  <string>
 for we which have believed do enter into rest as he said as i have sworn in my wrath if they shall enter into my rest although the works were finished from the foundation of the world</string>
  <string>
 for he spake in a certain place of the seventh day on this wise god did rest the seventh day from all his works</string>
  <string>
 in this place again if they shall enter into my rest</string>
  <string>
 seeing therefore it remaineth that some must enter therein and they to whom it was first preached entered not in because of unbelief
 again he limiteth a certain day saying in david to day after so long a time</string>
  <string> as it is said to day if ye will hear his voice harden not your hearts</string>
  <string>
 for if jesus had given them rest then would he not afterward have spoken of another day</string>
  <string>
 there remaineth therefore a rest to the people of god</string>
  <string>
 for he that is entered into his rest he also hath ceased from his own works as god did from his</string>
  <string>
 let us labour therefore to enter into that rest lest any man fall after the same example of unbelief</string>
  <string>
 for the word of god is quick and powerful and sharper than any twoedged sword piercing even to the dividing asunder of soul and spirit and of the joints and marrow and is a discerner of the thoughts and intents of the heart</string>
  <string>
 neither is there any creature that is not manifest in his sight but all things are naked and opened unto the eyes of him with whom we have to do</string>
  <string>
 seeing then that we have a great high priest that is passed into the heavens jesus the son of god let us hold fast our profession</string>
  <string>
 for we have not an high priest which cannot be touched with the feeling of our infirmities</string>
  <string> but was in all points tempted like as we are yet without sin</string>
  <string>
 let us therefore come boldly unto the throne of grace that we may obtain mercy and find grace to help in time of need</string>
  <string>
 
 for every high priest taken from among men is ordained for men in things pertaining to god that he may offer both gifts and sacrifices for sins
 who can have compassion on the ignorant and on them that are out of the way</string>
  <string> for that he himself also is compassed with infirmity</string>
  <string>
 by reason hereof he ought as for the people so also for himself to offer for sins</string>
  <string>
 no man taketh this honour unto himself but he that is called of god as was aaron</string>
  <string>
 so also christ glorified not himself to be made an high priest</string>
  <string> but he that said unto him thou art my son to day have i begotten thee</string>
  <string>
 as he saith also in another place thou art a priest for ever after the order of melchisedec</string>
  <string>
 who in the days of his flesh when he had offered up prayers and supplications with strong crying and tears unto him that was able to save him from death and was heard in that he feared</string>
  <string>
 though he were a son yet learned he obedience by the things which he suffered</string>
  <string>
 being made perfect he became the author of eternal salvation unto all them that obey him</string>
  <string>
 called of god an high priest after the order of melchisedec</string>
  <string>
 of whom we have many things to say and hard to be uttered seeing ye are dull of hearing</string>
  <string>
 for when for the time ye ought to be teachers ye have need that one teach you again which be the first principles of the oracles of god</string>
  <string> and are become such as have need of milk and not of strong meat</string>
  <string>
 for every one that useth milk is unskilful in the word of righteousness for he is a babe</string>
  <string>
 but strong meat belongeth to them that are of full age even those who by reason of use have their senses exercised to discern both good and evil</string>
  <string>
 
 therefore leaving the principles of the doctrine of christ let us go on unto perfection</string>
  <string> not laying again the foundation of repentance from dead works and of faith toward god
 of the doctrine of baptisms and of laying on of hands and of resurrection of the dead and of eternal judgment</string>
  <string>
 this will we do if god permit</string>
  <string>
 for it is impossible for those who were once enlightened and have tasted of the heavenly gift and were made partakers of the holy ghost
 have tasted the good word of god and the powers of the world to come
 if they shall fall away to renew them again unto repentance</string>
  <string> seeing they crucify to themselves the son of god afresh and put him to an open shame</string>
  <string>
 for the earth which drinketh in the rain that cometh oft upon it and bringeth forth herbs meet for them by whom it is dressed receiveth blessing from god
 but that which beareth thorns and briers is rejected and is nigh unto cursing</string>
  <string> whose end is to be burned</string>
  <string>
 but beloved we are persuaded better things of you and things that accompany salvation though we thus speak</string>
  <string>
 for god is not unrighteous to forget your work and labour of love which ye have shewed toward his name in that ye have ministered to the saints and do minister</string>
  <string>
 we desire that every one of you do shew the same diligence to the full assurance of hope unto the end
 that ye be not slothful but followers of them who through faith and patience inherit the promises</string>
  <string>
 for when god made promise to abraham because he could swear by no greater he sware by himself
 saying surely blessing i will bless thee and multiplying i will multiply thee</string>
  <string>
 so after he had patiently endured he obtained the promise</string>
  <string>
 for men verily swear by the greater and an oath for confirmation is to them an end of all strife</string>
  <string>
 wherein god willing more abundantly to shew unto the heirs of promise the immutability of his counsel confirmed it by an oath
 that by two immutable things in which it was impossible for god to lie we might have a strong consolation who have fled for refuge to lay hold upon the hope set before us
 which hope we have as an anchor of the soul both sure and stedfast and which entereth into that within the veil</string>
  <string>
 whither the forerunner is for us entered even jesus made an high priest for ever after the order of melchisedec</string>
  <string>
 
 for this melchisedec king of salem priest of the most high god who met abraham returning from the slaughter of the kings and blessed him</string>
  <string>
 to whom also abraham gave a tenth part of all</string>
  <string> first being by interpretation king of righteousness and after that also king of salem which is king of peace</string>
  <string>
 without father without mother without descent having neither beginning of days nor end of life</string>
  <string> but made like unto the son of god</string>
  <string> abideth a priest continually</string>
  <string>
 now consider how great this man was unto whom even the patriarch abraham gave the tenth of the spoils</string>
  <string>
 verily they that are of the sons of levi who receive the office of the priesthood have a commandment to take tithes of the people according to the law that is of their brethren though they come out of the loins of abraham
 but he whose descent is not counted from them received tithes of abraham and blessed him that had the promises</string>
  <string>
 without all contradiction the less is blessed of the better</string>
  <string>
 here men that die receive tithes</string>
  <string> but there he receiveth them of whom it is witnessed that he liveth</string>
  <string>
 as i may so say levi also who receiveth tithes payed tithes in abraham</string>
  <string>
 for he was yet in the loins of his father when melchisedec met him</string>
  <string>
 if therefore perfection were by the levitical priesthood for under it the people received the law what further need was there that another priest should rise after the order of melchisedec and not be called after the order of aaron</string>
  <string>
 for the priesthood being changed there is made of necessity a change also of the law</string>
  <string>
 for he of whom these things are spoken pertaineth to another tribe of which no man gave attendance at the altar</string>
  <string>
 for it is evident that our lord sprang out of juda</string>
  <string> of which tribe moses spake nothing concerning priesthood</string>
  <string>
 it is yet far more evident for that after the similitude of melchisedec there ariseth another priest
 who is made not after the law of a carnal commandment but after the power of an endless life</string>
  <string>
 for he testifieth thou art a priest for ever after the order of melchisedec</string>
  <string>
 for there is verily a disannulling of the commandment going before for the weakness and unprofitableness thereof</string>
  <string>
 for the law made nothing perfect but the bringing in of a better hope did </string>
  <string> by the which we draw nigh unto god</string>
  <string>
 inasmuch as not without an oath he was made priest 
 for those priests were made without an oath</string>
  <string> but this with an oath by him that said unto him the lord sware and will not repent thou art a priest for ever after the order of melchisedec
 by so much was jesus made a surety of a better testament</string>
  <string>
 they truly were many priests because they were not suffered to continue by reason of death
 but this man because he continueth ever hath an unchangeable priesthood</string>
  <string>
 wherefore he is able also to save them to the uttermost that come unto god by him seeing he ever liveth to make intercession for them</string>
  <string>
 for such an high priest became us who is holy harmless undefiled separate from sinners and made higher than the heavens</string>
  <string>
 who needeth not daily as those high priests to offer up sacrifice first for his own sins and then for the people's for this he did once when he offered up himself</string>
  <string>
 for the law maketh men high priests which have infirmity</string>
  <string> but the word of the oath which was since the law maketh the son who is consecrated for evermore</string>
  <string>
 
 now of the things which we have spoken this is the sum we have such an high priest who is set on the right hand of the throne of the majesty in the heavens</string>
  <string>
 a minister of the sanctuary and of the true tabernacle which the lord pitched and not man</string>
  <string>
 for every high priest is ordained to offer gifts and sacrifices wherefore it is of necessity that this man have somewhat also to offer</string>
  <string>
 for if he were on earth he should not be a priest seeing that there are priests that offer gifts according to the law
 who serve unto the example and shadow of heavenly things as moses was admonished of god when he was about to make the tabernacle for see saith he that thou make all things according to the pattern shewed to thee in the mount</string>
  <string>
 but now hath he obtained a more excellent ministry by how much also he is the mediator of a better covenant which was established upon better promises</string>
  <string>
 for if that first covenant had been faultless then should no place have been sought for the second</string>
  <string>
 for finding fault with them he saith behold the days come saith the lord when i will make a new covenant with the house of israel and with the house of judah
 not according to the covenant that i made with their fathers in the day when i took them by the hand to lead them out of the land of egypt</string>
  <string> because they continued not in my covenant and i regarded them not saith the lord</string>
  <string>
 for this is the covenant that i will make with the house of israel after those days saith the lord</string>
  <string> i will put my laws into their mind and write them in their hearts and i will be to them a god and they shall be to me a people
 they shall not teach every man his neighbour and every man his brother saying know the lord for all shall know me from the least to the greatest</string>
  <string>
 for i will be merciful to their unrighteousness and their sins and their iniquities will i remember no more</string>
  <string>
 in that he saith a new covenant he hath made the first old</string>
  <string> now that which decayeth and waxeth old is ready to vanish away</string>
  <string>
 
 then verily the first covenant had also ordinances of divine service and a worldly sanctuary</string>
  <string>
 for there was a tabernacle made</string>
  <string> the first wherein was the candlestick and the table and the shewbread</string>
  <string> which is called the sanctuary</string>
  <string>
 after the second veil the tabernacle which is called the holiest of all</string>
  <string>
 which had the golden censer and the ark of the covenant overlaid round about with gold wherein was the golden pot that had manna and aaron's rod that budded and the tables of the covenant</string>
  <string>
 over it the cherubims of glory shadowing the mercyseat</string>
  <string> of which we cannot now speak particularly</string>
  <string>
 now when these things were thus ordained the priests went always into the first tabernacle accomplishing the service of god </string>
  <string>
 but into the second went the high priest alone once every year not without blood which he offered for himself and for the errors of the people
 the holy ghost this signifying that the way into the holiest of all was not yet made manifest while as the first tabernacle was yet standing
 which was a figure for the time then present in which were offered both gifts and sacrifices that could not make him that did the service perfect as pertaining to the conscience</string>
  <string>
 which stood only in meats and drinks and divers washings and carnal ordinances imposed on them until the time of reformation</string>
  <string>
 but christ being come an high priest of good things to come by a greater and more perfect tabernacle not made with hands that is to say not of this building</string>
  <string>
 neither by the blood of goats and calves but by his own blood he entered in once into the holy place having obtained eternal redemption for us </string>
  <string>
 for if the blood of bulls and of goats and the ashes of an heifer sprinkling the unclean sanctifieth to the purifying of the flesh
 how much more shall the blood of christ who through the eternal spirit offered himself without spot to god purge your conscience from dead works to serve the living god</string>
  <string>
 for this cause he is the mediator of the new testament that by means of death for the redemption of the transgressions that were under the first testament they which are called might receive the promise of eternal inheritance</string>
  <string>
 for where a testament is there must also of necessity be the death of the testator</string>
  <string>
 for a testament is of force after men are dead otherwise it is of no strength at all while the testator liveth</string>
  <string>
 whereupon neither the first testament was dedicated without blood</string>
  <string>
 for when moses had spoken every precept to all the people according to the law he took the blood of calves and of goats with water and scarlet wool and hyssop and sprinkled both the book and all the people
 saying this is the blood of the testament which god hath enjoined unto you</string>
  <string>
 moreover he sprinkled with blood both the tabernacle and all the vessels of the ministry</string>
  <string>
 almost all things are by the law purged with blood</string>
  <string> and without shedding of blood is no remission</string>
  <string>
 it was therefore necessary that the patterns of things in the heavens should be purified with these</string>
  <string> but the heavenly things themselves with better sacrifices than these</string>
  <string>
 for christ is not entered into the holy places made with hands which are the figures of the true</string>
  <string> but into heaven itself now to appear in the presence of god for us
 nor yet that he should offer himself often as the high priest entereth into the holy place every year with blood of others</string>
  <string>
 for then must he often have suffered since the foundation of the world but now once in the end of the world hath he appeared to put away sin by the sacrifice of himself</string>
  <string>
 as it is appointed unto men once to die but after this the judgment
 so christ was once offered to bear the sins of many</string>
  <string> and unto them that look for him shall he appear the second time without sin unto salvation</string>
  <string>
 
 for the law having a shadow of good things to come and not the very image of the things can never with those sacrifices which they offered year by year continually make the comers thereunto perfect</string>
  <string>
 for then would they not have ceased to be offered</string>
  <string> because that the worshippers once purged should have had no more conscience of sins</string>
  <string>
 but in those sacrifices there is a remembrance again made of sins every year</string>
  <string>
 for it is not possible that the blood of bulls and of goats should take away sins</string>
  <string>
 wherefore when he cometh into the world he saith sacrifice and offering thou wouldest not but a body hast thou prepared me
 in burnt offerings and sacrifices for sin thou hast had no pleasure</string>
  <string>
 then said i lo i come in the volume of the book it is written of me to do thy will o god</string>
  <string>
 above when he said sacrifice and offering and burnt offerings and offering for sin thou wouldest not neither hadst pleasure therein </string>
  <string> which are offered by the law</string>
  <string>
 then said he lo i come to do thy will o god</string>
  <string> he taketh away the first that he may establish the second</string>
  <string>
 by the which will we are sanctified through the offering of the body of jesus christ once for all </string>
  <string>
 every priest standeth daily ministering and offering oftentimes the same sacrifices which can never take away sins
 but this man after he had offered one sacrifice for sins for ever sat down on the right hand of god</string>
  <string>
 from henceforth expecting till his enemies be made his footstool</string>
  <string>
 for by one offering he hath perfected for ever them that are sanctified</string>
  <string>
 whereof the holy ghost also is a witness to us for after that he had said before
 this is the covenant that i will make with them after those days saith the lord i will put my laws into their hearts and in their minds will i write them</string>
  <string>
 their sins and iniquities will i remember no more</string>
  <string>
 now where remission of these is there is no more offering for sin</string>
  <string>
 having therefore brethren boldness to enter into the holiest by the blood of jesus
 by a new and living way which he hath consecrated for us through the veil that is to say his flesh</string>
  <string>
 having an high priest over the house of god</string>
  <string>
 let us draw near with a true heart in full assurance of faith having our hearts sprinkled from an evil conscience and our bodies washed with pure water</string>
  <string>
 let us hold fast the profession of our faith without wavering</string>
  <string> for he is faithful that promised</string>
  <string>
 let us consider one another to provoke unto love and to good works
 not forsaking the assembling of ourselves together as the manner of some is </string>
  <string> but exhorting one another  and so much the more as ye see the day approaching</string>
  <string>
 for if we sin wilfully after that we have received the knowledge of the truth there remaineth no more sacrifice for sins
 but a certain fearful looking for of judgment and fiery indignation which shall devour the adversaries</string>
  <string>
 he that despised moses' law died without mercy under two or three witnesses
 of how much sorer punishment suppose ye shall he be thought worthy who hath trodden under foot the son of god and hath counted the blood of the covenant wherewith he was sanctified an unholy thing and hath done despite unto the spirit of grace</string>
  <string>
 for we know him that hath said vengeance belongeth unto me i will recompense saith the lord</string>
  <string> again the lord shall judge his people</string>
  <string>
 it is a fearful thing to fall into the hands of the living god</string>
  <string>
 but call to remembrance the former days in which after ye were illuminated ye endured a great fight of afflictions</string>
  <string>
 partly whilst ye were made a gazingstock both by reproaches and afflictions</string>
  <string> and partly whilst ye became companions of them that were so used</string>
  <string>
 for ye had compassion of me in my bonds and took joyfully the spoiling of your goods knowing in yourselves that ye have in heaven a better and an enduring substance</string>
  <string>
 cast not away therefore your confidence which hath great recompence of reward</string>
  <string>
 for ye have need of patience that after ye have done the will of god ye might receive the promise</string>
  <string>
 for yet a little while and he that shall come will come and will not tarry</string>
  <string>
 now the just shall live by faith but if any man draw back my soul shall have no pleasure in him</string>
  <string>
 but we are not of them who draw back unto perdition</string>
  <string> but of them that believe to the saving of the soul</string>
  <string>
 
 now faith is the substance of things hoped for the evidence of things not seen</string>
  <string>
 for by it the elders obtained a good report</string>
  <string>
 through faith we understand that the worlds were framed by the word of god so that things which are seen were not made of things which do appear</string>
  <string>
 by faith abel offered unto god a more excellent sacrifice than cain by which he obtained witness that he was righteous god testifying of his gifts and by it he being dead yet speaketh</string>
  <string>
 by faith enoch was translated that he should not see death</string>
  <string> and was not found because god had translated him for before his translation he had this testimony that he pleased god</string>
  <string>
 but without faith it is impossible to please him  for he that cometh to god must believe that he is and that he is a rewarder of them that diligently seek him</string>
  <string>
 by faith noah being warned of god of things not seen as yet moved with fear prepared an ark to the saving of his house</string>
  <string> by the which he condemned the world and became heir of the righteousness which is by faith</string>
  <string>
 by faith abraham when he was called to go out into a place which he should after receive for an inheritance obeyed</string>
  <string> and he went out not knowing whither he went</string>
  <string>
 by faith he sojourned in the land of promise as in a strange country dwelling in tabernacles with isaac and jacob the heirs with him of the same promise
 for he looked for a city which hath foundations whose builder and maker is god</string>
  <string>
 through faith also sara herself received strength to conceive seed and was delivered of a child when she was past age because she judged him faithful who had promised</string>
  <string>
 therefore sprang there even of one and him as good as dead so many as the stars of the sky in multitude and as the sand which is by the sea shore innumerable</string>
  <string>
 these all died in faith not having received the promises but having seen them afar off and were persuaded of them and embraced them and confessed that they were strangers and pilgrims on the earth</string>
  <string>
 for they that say such things declare plainly that they seek a country</string>
  <string>
 truly if they had been mindful of that country from whence they came out they might have had opportunity to have returned</string>
  <string>
 but now they desire a better country that is an heavenly wherefore god is not ashamed to be called their god for he hath prepared for them a city</string>
  <string>
 by faith abraham when he was tried offered up isaac and he that had received the promises offered up his only begotten son 
 of whom it was said that in isaac shall thy seed be called
 accounting that god was able to raise him up even from the dead</string>
  <string> from whence also he received him in a figure</string>
  <string>
 by faith isaac blessed jacob and esau concerning things to come</string>
  <string>
 by faith jacob when he was a dying blessed both the sons of joseph</string>
  <string> and worshipped leaning upon the top of his staff</string>
  <string>
 by faith joseph when he died made mention of the departing of the children of israel</string>
  <string> and gave commandment concerning his bones</string>
  <string>
 by faith moses when he was born was hid three months of his parents because they saw he was a proper child</string>
  <string> and they were not afraid of the king's commandment</string>
  <string>
 by faith moses when he was come to years refused to be called the son of pharaoh's daughter</string>
  <string>
 choosing rather to suffer affliction with the people of god than to enjoy the pleasures of sin for a season</string>
  <string>
 esteeming the reproach of christ greater riches than the treasures in egypt for he had respect unto the recompence of the reward</string>
  <string>
 by faith he forsook egypt not fearing the wrath of the king for he endured as seeing him who is invisible</string>
  <string>
 through faith he kept the passover and the sprinkling of blood lest he that destroyed the firstborn should touch them</string>
  <string>
 by faith they passed through the red sea as by dry land  which the egyptians assaying to do were drowned</string>
  <string>
 by faith the walls of jericho fell down after they were compassed about seven days</string>
  <string>
 by faith the harlot rahab perished not with them that believed not when she had received the spies with peace</string>
  <string>
 what shall i more say</string>
  <string> for the time would fail me to tell of gedeon and of barak and of samson and of jephthae</string>
  <string> of david also and samuel and of the prophets
 who through faith subdued kingdoms wrought righteousness obtained promises stopped the mouths of lions
 quenched the violence of fire escaped the edge of the sword out of weakness were made strong waxed valiant in fight turned to flight the armies of the aliens</string>
  <string>
 women received their dead raised to life again and others were tortured not accepting deliverance</string>
  <string> that they might obtain a better resurrection
 others had trial of cruel mockings and scourgings yea moreover of bonds and imprisonment
 they were stoned they were sawn asunder were tempted were slain with the sword they wandered about in sheepskins and goatskins</string>
  <string> being destitute afflicted tormented</string>
  <string>
 of whom the world was not worthy they wandered in deserts and in mountains and in dens and caves of the earth</string>
  <string>
 these all having obtained a good report through faith received not the promise
 god having provided some better thing for us that they without us should not be made perfect</string>
  <string>
 
 wherefore seeing we also are compassed about with so great a cloud of witnesses let us lay aside every weight and the sin which doth so easily beset us and let us run with patience the race that is set before us
 looking unto jesus the author and finisher of our faith</string>
  <string> who for the joy that was set before him endured the cross despising the shame and is set down at the right hand of the throne of god</string>
  <string>
 for consider him that endured such contradiction of sinners against himself lest ye be wearied and faint in your minds</string>
  <string>
 ye have not yet resisted unto blood striving against sin</string>
  <string>
 ye have forgotten the exhortation which speaketh unto you as unto children my son despise not thou the chastening of the lord nor faint when thou art rebuked of him
 for whom the lord loveth he chasteneth and scourgeth every son whom he receiveth</string>
  <string>
 if ye endure chastening god dealeth with you as with sons</string>
  <string> for what son is he whom the father chasteneth not</string>
  <string>
 but if ye be without chastisement whereof all are partakers then are ye bastards and not sons</string>
  <string>
 furthermore we have had fathers of our flesh which corrected us and we gave them reverence shall we not much rather be in subjection unto the father of spirits and live</string>
  <string>
 for they verily for a few days chastened us after their own pleasure</string>
  <string> but he for our profit that we might be partakers of his holiness</string>
  <string>
 now no chastening for the present seemeth to be joyous but grievous nevertheless afterward it yieldeth the peaceable fruit of righteousness unto them which are exercised thereby</string>
  <string>
 wherefore lift up the hands which hang down and the feeble knees</string>
  <string>
 make straight paths for your feet lest that which is lame be turned out of the way</string>
  <string> but let it rather be healed</string>
  <string>
 follow peace with all men and holiness without which no man shall see the lord
 looking diligently lest any man fail of the grace of god</string>
  <string> lest any root of bitterness springing up trouble you and thereby many be defiled</string>
  <string>
 lest there be any fornicator or profane person as esau who for one morsel of meat sold his birthright</string>
  <string>
 for ye know how that afterward when he would have inherited the blessing he was rejected for he found no place of repentance though he sought it carefully with tears</string>
  <string>
 for ye are not come unto the mount that might be touched and that burned with fire nor unto blackness and darkness and tempest
 the sound of a trumpet and the voice of words</string>
  <string> which voice they that heard intreated that the word should not be spoken to them any more
 for they could not endure that which was commanded if so much as a beast touch the mountain it shall be stoned or thrust through with a dart
 so terrible was the sight that moses said i exceedingly fear and quake
 but ye are come unto mount sion and unto the city of the living god the heavenly jerusalem and to an innumerable company of angels
 to the general assembly and church of the firstborn which are written in heaven and to god the judge of all and to the spirits of just men made perfect
 to jesus the mediator of the new covenant and to the blood of sprinkling that speaketh better things than that of abel</string>
  <string>
 see that ye refuse not him that speaketh</string>
  <string> for if they escaped not who refused him that spake on earth much more shall not we escape if we turn away from him that speaketh from heaven
 whose voice then shook the earth but now he hath promised saying yet once more i shake not the earth only but also heaven</string>
  <string>
 this word yet once more signifieth the removing of those things that are shaken as of things that are made that those things which cannot be shaken may remain</string>
  <string>
 wherefore we receiving a kingdom which cannot be moved let us have grace whereby we may serve god acceptably with reverence and godly fear
 for our god is a consuming fire</string>
  <string>
 
 let brotherly love continue</string>
  <string>
 be not forgetful to entertain strangers for thereby some have entertained angels unawares</string>
  <string>
 remember them that are in bonds as bound with them</string>
  <string> and them which suffer adversity as being yourselves also in the body</string>
  <string>
 marriage is honourable in all and the bed undefiled but whoremongers and adulterers god will judge</string>
  <string>
 let your conversation be without covetousness</string>
  <string> and be content with such things as ye have for he hath said i will never leave thee nor forsake thee</string>
  <string>
 so that we may boldly say the lord is my helper and i will not fear what man shall do unto me</string>
  <string>
 remember them which have the rule over you who have spoken unto you the word of god whose faith follow considering the end of their conversation</string>
  <string>
 jesus christ the same yesterday and to day and for ever</string>
  <string>
 be not carried about with divers and strange doctrines</string>
  <string> for it is a good thing that the heart be established with grace</string>
  <string> not with meats which have not profited them that have been occupied therein</string>
  <string>
 we have an altar whereof they have no right to eat which serve the tabernacle</string>
  <string>
 for the bodies of those beasts whose blood is brought into the sanctuary by the high priest for sin are burned without the camp</string>
  <string>
 wherefore jesus also that he might sanctify the people with his own blood suffered without the gate</string>
  <string>
 let us go forth therefore unto him without the camp bearing his reproach</string>
  <string>
 for here have we no continuing city but we seek one to come</string>
  <string>
 by him therefore let us offer the sacrifice of praise to god continually that is the fruit of our lips giving thanks to his name</string>
  <string>
 but to do good and to communicate forget not for with such sacrifices god is well pleased</string>
  <string>
 obey them that have the rule over you and submit yourselves for they watch for your souls as they that must give account that they may do it with joy and not with grief for that is unprofitable for you</string>
  <string>
 pray for us for we trust we have a good conscience in all things willing to live honestly</string>
  <string>
 but i beseech you the rather to do this that i may be restored to you the sooner</string>
  <string>
 now the god of peace that brought again from the dead our lord jesus that great shepherd of the sheep through the blood of the everlasting covenant
 make you perfect in every good work to do his will working in you that which is wellpleasing in his sight through jesus christ</string>
  <string> to whom be glory for ever and ever</string>
  <string> amen</string>
  <string>
 i beseech you brethren suffer the word of exhortation for i have written a letter unto you in few words</string>
  <string>
 know ye that our brother timothy is set at liberty</string>
  <string> with whom if he come shortly i will see you</string>
  <string>
 salute all them that have the rule over you and all the saints</string>
  <string> they of italy salute you</string>
  <string>
 grace be with you all</string>
  <string> amen</string>
  <string>
 written to the hebrews from italy by timothy</string>
  <string>
 the general epistle of james
 
 james a servant of god and of the lord jesus christ to the twelve tribes which are scattered abroad greeting</string>
  <string>
 my brethren count it all joy when ye fall into divers temptations</string>
  <string>
 knowing this that the trying of your faith worketh patience</string>
  <string>
 but let patience have her perfect work that ye may be perfect and entire wanting nothing</string>
  <string>
 if any of you lack wisdom let him ask of god that giveth to all men liberally and upbraideth not</string>
  <string> and it shall be given him</string>
  <string>
 but let him ask in faith nothing wavering</string>
  <string> for he that wavereth is like a wave of the sea driven with the wind and tossed</string>
  <string>
 for let not that man think that he shall receive any thing of the lord</string>
  <string>
 a double minded man is unstable in all his ways</string>
  <string>
 let the brother of low degree rejoice in that he is exalted
 but the rich in that he is made low because as the flower of the grass he shall pass away</string>
  <string>
 for the sun is no sooner risen with a burning heat but it withereth the grass and the flower thereof falleth and the grace of the fashion of it perisheth so also shall the rich man fade away in his ways</string>
  <string>
 blessed is the man that endureth temptation for when he is tried he shall receive the crown of life which the lord hath promised to them that love him</string>
  <string>
 let no man say when he is tempted i am tempted of god for god cannot be tempted with evil neither tempteth he any man
 but every man is tempted when he is drawn away of his own lust and enticed</string>
  <string>
 then when lust hath conceived it bringeth forth sin and sin when it is finished bringeth forth death</string>
  <string>
 do not err my beloved brethren</string>
  <string>
 every good gift and every perfect gift is from above and cometh down from the father of lights with whom is no variableness neither shadow of turning</string>
  <string>
 of his own will begat he us with the word of truth that we should be a kind of firstfruits of his creatures</string>
  <string>
 wherefore my beloved brethren let every man be swift to hear slow to speak slow to wrath
 for the wrath of man worketh not the righteousness of god</string>
  <string>
 wherefore lay apart all filthiness and superfluity of naughtiness and receive with meekness the engrafted word which is able to save your souls</string>
  <string>
 but be ye doers of the word and not hearers only deceiving your own selves</string>
  <string>
 for if any be a hearer of the word and not a doer he is like unto a man beholding his natural face in a glass
 for he beholdeth himself and goeth his way and straightway forgetteth what manner of man he was</string>
  <string>
 but whoso looketh into the perfect law of liberty and continueth therein he being not a forgetful hearer but a doer of the work this man shall be blessed in his deed</string>
  <string>
 if any man among you seem to be religious and bridleth not his tongue but deceiveth his own heart this man's religion is vain</string>
  <string>
 pure religion and undefiled before god and the father is this to visit the fatherless and widows in their affliction and to keep himself unspotted from the world</string>
  <string>
 
 my brethren have not the faith of our lord jesus christ the lord of glory with respect of persons</string>
  <string>
 for if there come unto your assembly a man with a gold ring in goodly apparel and there come in also a poor man in vile raiment</string>
  <string>
 ye have respect to him that weareth the gay clothing and say unto him sit thou here in a good place</string>
  <string> and say to the poor stand thou there or sit here under my footstool
 are ye not then partial in yourselves and are become judges of evil thoughts</string>
  <string>
 hearken my beloved brethren hath not god chosen the poor of this world rich in faith and heirs of the kingdom which he hath promised to them that love him</string>
  <string>
 but ye have despised the poor</string>
  <string> do not rich men oppress you and draw you before the judgment seats</string>
  <string>
 do not they blaspheme that worthy name by the which ye are called</string>
  <string>
 if ye fulfil the royal law according to the scripture thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself ye do well
 but if ye have respect to persons ye commit sin and are convinced of the law as transgressors</string>
  <string>
 for whosoever shall keep the whole law and yet offend in one point he is guilty of all</string>
  <string>
 for he that said do not commit adultery said also do not kill</string>
  <string> now if thou commit no adultery yet if thou kill thou art become a transgressor of the law</string>
  <string>
 so speak ye and so do as they that shall be judged by the law of liberty</string>
  <string>
 for he shall have judgment without mercy that hath shewed no mercy</string>
  <string> and mercy rejoiceth against judgment</string>
  <string>
 what doth it profit my brethren though a man say he hath faith and have not works</string>
  <string> can faith save him</string>
  <string>
 if a brother or sister be naked and destitute of daily food
 one of you say unto them depart in peace be ye warmed and filled</string>
  <string> notwithstanding ye give them not those things which are needful to the body</string>
  <string> what doth it profit</string>
  <string>
 even so faith if it hath not works is dead being alone</string>
  <string>
 yea a man may say thou hast faith and i have works shew me thy faith without thy works and i will shew thee my faith by my works</string>
  <string>
 thou believest that there is one god</string>
  <string> thou doest well the devils also believe and tremble</string>
  <string>
 but wilt thou know o vain man that faith without works is dead</string>
  <string>
 was not abraham our father justified by works when he had offered isaac his son upon the altar</string>
  <string>
 seest thou how faith wrought with his works and by works was faith made perfect</string>
  <string>
 the scripture was fulfilled which saith abraham believed god and it was imputed unto him for righteousness and he was called the friend of god</string>
  <string>
 ye see then how that by works a man is justified and not by faith only</string>
  <string>
 likewise also was not rahab the harlot justified by works when she had received the messengers and had sent them out another way</string>
  <string>
 for as the body without the spirit is dead so faith without works is dead also</string>
  <string>
 
 my brethren be not many masters knowing that we shall receive the greater condemnation</string>
  <string>
 for in many things we offend all</string>
  <string> if any man offend not in word the same is a perfect man and able also to bridle the whole body</string>
  <string>
 behold we put bits in the horses' mouths that they may obey us</string>
  <string> and we turn about their whole body</string>
  <string>
 behold also the ships which though they be so great and are driven of fierce winds yet are they turned about with a very small helm whithersoever the governor listeth</string>
  <string>
 even so the tongue is a little member and boasteth great things</string>
  <string> behold how great a matter a little fire kindleth</string>
  <string>
 the tongue is a fire a world of iniquity so is the tongue among our members that it defileth the whole body and setteth on fire the course of nature</string>
  <string> and it is set on fire of hell</string>
  <string>
 for every kind of beasts and of birds and of serpents and of things in the sea is tamed and hath been tamed of mankind
 but the tongue can no man tame</string>
  <string> it is an unruly evil full of deadly poison</string>
  <string>
 therewith bless we god even the father</string>
  <string> and therewith curse we men which are made after the similitude of god</string>
  <string>
 out of the same mouth proceedeth blessing and cursing</string>
  <string> my brethren these things ought not so to be</string>
  <string>
 doth a fountain send forth at the same place sweet water and bitter</string>
  <string>
 can the fig tree my brethren bear olive berries</string>
  <string> either a vine figs</string>
  <string> so can no fountain both yield salt water and fresh</string>
  <string>
 who is a wise man and endued with knowledge among you</string>
  <string> let him shew out of a good conversation his works with meekness of wisdom</string>
  <string>
 but if ye have bitter envying and strife in your hearts glory not and lie not against the truth</string>
  <string>
 this wisdom descendeth not from above but is earthly sensual devilish</string>
  <string>
 for where envying and strife is there is confusion and every evil work</string>
  <string>
 but the wisdom that is from above is first pure then peaceable gentle and easy to be intreated full of mercy and good fruits without partiality and without hypocrisy</string>
  <string>
 the fruit of righteousness is sown in peace of them that make peace</string>
  <string>
 
 from whence come wars and fightings among you</string>
  <string> come they not hence even of your lusts that war in your members</string>
  <string>
 ye lust and have not ye kill and desire to have and cannot obtain ye fight and war yet ye have not because ye ask not</string>
  <string>
 ye ask and receive not because ye ask amiss that ye may consume it upon your lusts</string>
  <string>
 ye adulterers and adulteresses know ye not that the friendship of the world is enmity with god</string>
  <string> whosoever therefore will be a friend of the world is the enemy of god</string>
  <string>
 do ye think that the scripture saith in vain the spirit that dwelleth in us lusteth to envy</string>
  <string>
 but he giveth more grace</string>
  <string> wherefore he saith god resisteth the proud but giveth grace unto the humble</string>
  <string>
 submit yourselves therefore to god</string>
  <string> resist the devil and he will flee from you</string>
  <string>
 draw nigh to god and he will draw nigh to you</string>
  <string> cleanse your hands ye sinners</string>
  <string> and purify your hearts ye double minded</string>
  <string>
 be afflicted and mourn and weep let your laughter be turned to mourning and your joy to heaviness</string>
  <string>
 humble yourselves in the sight of the lord and he shall lift you up</string>
  <string>
 speak not evil one of another brethren</string>
  <string> he that speaketh evil of his brother and judgeth his brother speaketh evil of the law and judgeth the law but if thou judge the law thou art not a doer of the law but a judge</string>
  <string>
 there is one lawgiver who is able to save and to destroy who art thou that judgest another</string>
  <string>
 go to now ye that say to day or to morrow we will go into such a city and continue there a year and buy and sell and get gain
 whereas ye know not what shall be on the morrow</string>
  <string> for what is your life</string>
  <string> it is even a vapour that appeareth for a little time and then vanisheth away</string>
  <string>
 for that ye ought to say if the lord will we shall live and do this or that</string>
  <string>
 but now ye rejoice in your boastings all such rejoicing is evil</string>
  <string>
 therefore to him that knoweth to do good and doeth it not to him it is sin</string>
  <string>
 
 go to now ye rich men weep and howl for your miseries that shall come upon you </string>
  <string>
 your riches are corrupted and your garments are motheaten</string>
  <string>
 your gold and silver is cankered</string>
  <string> and the rust of them shall be a witness against you and shall eat your flesh as it were fire</string>
  <string> ye have heaped treasure together for the last days</string>
  <string>
 behold the hire of the labourers who have reaped down your fields which is of you kept back by fraud crieth and the cries of them which have reaped are entered into the ears of the lord of sabaoth</string>
  <string>
 ye have lived in pleasure on the earth and been wanton</string>
  <string> ye have nourished your hearts as in a day of slaughter</string>
  <string>
 ye have condemned and killed the just</string>
  <string> and he doth not resist you</string>
  <string>
 be patient therefore brethren unto the coming of the lord</string>
  <string> behold the husbandman waiteth for the precious fruit of the earth and hath long patience for it until he receive the early and latter rain</string>
  <string>
 be ye also patient</string>
  <string> stablish your hearts for the coming of the lord draweth nigh</string>
  <string>
 grudge not one against another brethren lest ye be condemned behold the judge standeth before the door</string>
  <string>
 take my brethren the prophets who have spoken in the name of the lord for an example of suffering affliction and of patience</string>
  <string>
 behold we count them happy which endure</string>
  <string> ye have heard of the patience of job and have seen the end of the lord</string>
  <string> that the lord is very pitiful and of tender mercy</string>
  <string>
 but above all things my brethren swear not neither by heaven neither by the earth neither by any other oath but let your yea be yea</string>
  <string> and your nay nay</string>
  <string> lest ye fall into condemnation</string>
  <string>
 is any among you afflicted</string>
  <string> let him pray</string>
  <string> is any merry</string>
  <string> let him sing psalms</string>
  <string>
 is any sick among you</string>
  <string> let him call for the elders of the church</string>
  <string> and let them pray over him anointing him with oil in the name of the lord
 the prayer of faith shall save the sick and the lord shall raise him up</string>
  <string> and if he have committed sins they shall be forgiven him</string>
  <string>
 confess your faults one to another and pray one for another that ye may be healed</string>
  <string> the effectual fervent prayer of a righteous man availeth much</string>
  <string>
 elias was a man subject to like passions as we are and he prayed earnestly that it might not rain and it rained not on the earth by the space of three years and six months</string>
  <string>
 he prayed again and the heaven gave rain and the earth brought forth her fruit</string>
  <string>
 brethren if any of you do err from the truth and one convert him</string>
  <string>
 let him know that he which converteth the sinner from the error of his way shall save a soul from death and shall hide a multitude of sins</string>
  <string>
 the first epistle general of peter
 
 peter an apostle of jesus christ to the strangers scattered throughout pontus galatia cappadocia asia and bithynia
 elect according to the foreknowledge of god the father through sanctification of the spirit unto obedience and sprinkling of the blood of jesus christ grace unto you and peace be multiplied</string>
  <string>
 blessed be the god and father of our lord jesus christ which according to his abundant mercy hath begotten us again unto a lively hope by the resurrection of jesus christ from the dead
 to an inheritance incorruptible and undefiled and that fadeth not away reserved in heaven for you
 who are kept by the power of god through faith unto salvation ready to be revealed in the last time</string>
  <string>
 wherein ye greatly rejoice though now for a season if need be ye are in heaviness through manifold temptations
 that the trial of your faith being much more precious than of gold that perisheth though it be tried with fire might be found unto praise and honour and glory at the appearing of jesus christ
 whom having not seen ye love</string>
  <string> in whom though now ye see him not yet believing ye rejoice with joy unspeakable and full of glory
 receiving the end of your faith even the salvation of your souls</string>
  <string>
 of which salvation the prophets have enquired and searched diligently who prophesied of the grace that should come unto you
 searching what or what manner of time the spirit of christ which was in them did signify when it testified beforehand the sufferings of christ and the glory that should follow</string>
  <string>
 unto whom it was revealed that not unto themselves but unto us they did minister the things which are now reported unto you by them that have preached the gospel unto you with the holy ghost sent down from heaven</string>
  <string> which things the angels desire to look into</string>
  <string>
 wherefore gird up the loins of your mind be sober and hope to the end for the grace that is to be brought unto you at the revelation of jesus christ</string>
  <string>
 as obedient children not fashioning yourselves according to the former lusts in your ignorance
 but as he which hath called you is holy so be ye holy in all manner of conversation</string>
  <string>
 because it is written be ye holy</string>
  <string> for i am holy</string>
  <string>
 if ye call on the father who without respect of persons judgeth according to every man's work pass the time of your sojourning here in fear
 forasmuch as ye know that ye were not redeemed with corruptible things as silver and gold from your vain conversation received by tradition from your fathers</string>
  <string>
 but with the precious blood of christ as of a lamb without blemish and without spot
 who verily was foreordained before the foundation of the world but was manifest in these last times for you
 who by him do believe in god that raised him up from the dead and gave him glory</string>
  <string> that your faith and hope might be in god</string>
  <string>
 seeing ye have purified your souls in obeying the truth through the spirit unto unfeigned love of the brethren see that ye love one another with a pure heart fervently
 being born again not of corruptible seed but of incorruptible by the word of god which liveth and abideth for ever</string>
  <string>
 for all flesh is as grass and all the glory of man as the flower of grass</string>
  <string> the grass withereth and the flower thereof falleth away
 but the word of the lord endureth for ever</string>
  <string> this is the word which by the gospel is preached unto you</string>
  <string>
 
 wherefore laying aside all malice and all guile and hypocrisies and envies and all evil speakings
 as newborn babes desire the sincere milk of the word that ye may grow thereby
 if so be ye have tasted that the lord is gracious</string>
  <string>
 to whom coming as unto a living stone disallowed indeed of men but chosen of god and precious
 ye also as lively stones are built up a spiritual house an holy priesthood to offer up spiritual sacrifices acceptable to god by jesus christ</string>
  <string>
 wherefore also it is contained in the scripture behold i lay in sion a chief corner stone elect precious and he that believeth on him shall not be confounded</string>
  <string>
 unto you therefore which believe he is precious but unto them which be disobedient the stone which the builders disallowed the same is made the head of the corner
 a stone of stumbling and a rock of offence even to them which stumble at the word being disobedient whereunto also they were appointed</string>
  <string>
 but ye are a chosen generation a royal priesthood an holy nation a peculiar people</string>
  <string> that ye should shew forth the praises of him who hath called you out of darkness into his marvellous light
 which in time past were not a people but are now the people of god which had not obtained mercy but now have obtained mercy</string>
  <string>
 dearly beloved i beseech you as strangers and pilgrims abstain from fleshly lusts which war against the soul</string>
  <string>
 having your conversation honest among the gentiles that whereas they speak against you as evildoers they may by your good works which they shall behold glorify god in the day of visitation</string>
  <string>
 submit yourselves to every ordinance of man for the lord's sake whether it be to the king as supreme</string>
  <string>
 or unto governors as unto them that are sent by him for the punishment of evildoers and for the praise of them that do well</string>
  <string>
 for so is the will of god that with well doing ye may put to silence the ignorance of foolish men
 as free and not using your liberty for a cloke of maliciousness but as the servants of god</string>
  <string>
 honour all men </string>
  <string> love the brotherhood</string>
  <string> fear god</string>
  <string> honour the king</string>
  <string>
 servants be subject to your masters with all fear</string>
  <string> not only to the good and gentle but also to the froward</string>
  <string>
 for this is thankworthy if a man for conscience toward god endure grief suffering wrongfully</string>
  <string>
 for what glory is it if when ye be buffeted for your faults ye shall take it patiently</string>
  <string> but if when ye do well and suffer for it ye take it patiently this is acceptable with god</string>
  <string>
 for even hereunto were ye called because christ also suffered for us leaving us an example that ye should follow his steps
 who did no sin neither was guile found in his mouth
 who when he was reviled reviled not again</string>
  <string> when he suffered he threatened not</string>
  <string> but committed himself to him that judgeth righteously
 who his own self bare our sins in his own body on the tree that we being dead to sins should live unto righteousness by whose stripes ye were healed</string>
  <string>
 for ye were as sheep going astray</string>
  <string> but are now returned unto the shepherd and bishop of your souls</string>
  <string>
 
 likewise ye wives be in subjection to your own husbands</string>
  <string> that if any obey not the word they also may without the word be won by the conversation of the wives</string>
  <string>
 while they behold your chaste conversation coupled with fear</string>
  <string>
 whose adorning let it not be that outward adorning of plaiting the hair and of wearing of gold or of putting on of apparel</string>
  <string>
 but let it be the hidden man of the heart in that which is not corruptible even the ornament of a meek and quiet spirit which is in the sight of god of great price</string>
  <string>
 for after this manner in the old time the holy women also who trusted in god adorned themselves being in subjection unto their own husbands
 even as sara obeyed abraham calling him lord whose daughters ye are as long as ye do well and are not afraid with any amazement</string>
  <string>
 likewise ye husbands dwell with them according to knowledge giving honour unto the wife as unto the weaker vessel and as being heirs together of the grace of life</string>
  <string> that your prayers be not hindered</string>
  <string>
 finally be ye all of one mind having compassion one of another love as brethren be pitiful be courteous
 not rendering evil for evil or railing for railing but contrariwise blessing</string>
  <string> knowing that ye are thereunto called that ye should inherit a blessing</string>
  <string>
 for he that will love life and see good days let him refrain his tongue from evil and his lips that they speak no guile
 let him eschew evil and do good</string>
  <string> let him seek peace and ensue it</string>
  <string>
 for the eyes of the lord are over the righteous and his ears are open unto their prayers but the face of the lord is against them that do evil</string>
  <string>
 who is he that will harm you if ye be followers of that which is good</string>
  <string>
 but and if ye suffer for righteousness' sake happy are ye  and be not afraid of their terror neither be troubled</string>
  <string>
 but sanctify the lord god in your hearts and be ready always to give an answer to every man that asketh you a reason of the hope that is in you with meekness and fear
 having a good conscience</string>
  <string> that whereas they speak evil of you as of evildoers they may be ashamed that falsely accuse your good conversation in christ</string>
  <string>
 for it is better if the will of god be so that ye suffer for well doing than for evil doing</string>
  <string>
 for christ also hath once suffered for sins the just for the unjust that he might bring us to god being put to death in the flesh but quickened by the spirit
 by which also he went and preached unto the spirits in prison</string>
  <string>
 which sometime were disobedient when once the longsuffering of god waited in the days of noah while the ark was a preparing wherein few that is eight souls were saved by water</string>
  <string>
 the like figure whereunto even baptism doth also now save us not the putting away of the filth of the flesh but the answer of a good conscience toward god by the resurrection of jesus christ
 who is gone into heaven and is on the right hand of god</string>
  <string> angels and authorities and powers being made subject unto him</string>
  <string>
 
 forasmuch then as christ hath suffered for us in the flesh arm yourselves likewise with the same mind for he that hath suffered in the flesh hath ceased from sin</string>
  <string>
 that he no longer should live the rest of his time in the flesh to the lusts of men but to the will of god</string>
  <string>
 for the time past of our life may suffice us to have wrought the will of the gentiles when we walked in lasciviousness lusts excess of wine revellings banquetings and abominable idolatries
 wherein they think it strange that ye run not with them to the same excess of riot speaking evil of you 
 who shall give account to him that is ready to judge the quick and the dead</string>
  <string>
 for for this cause was the gospel preached also to them that are dead that they might be judged according to men in the flesh but live according to god in the spirit</string>
  <string>
 but the end of all things is at hand be ye therefore sober and watch unto prayer</string>
  <string>
 above all things have fervent charity among yourselves for charity shall cover the multitude of sins</string>
  <string>
 use hospitality one to another without grudging</string>
  <string>
 as every man hath received the gift even so minister the same one to another as good stewards of the manifold grace of god</string>
  <string>
 if any man speak let him speak as the oracles of god</string>
  <string> if any man minister let him do it as of the ability which god giveth that god in all things may be glorified through jesus christ to whom be praise and dominion for ever and ever</string>
  <string> amen</string>
  <string>
 beloved think it not strange concerning the fiery trial which is to try you as though some strange thing happened unto you
 but rejoice inasmuch as ye are partakers of christ's sufferings</string>
  <string> that when his glory shall be revealed ye may be glad also with exceeding joy</string>
  <string>
 if ye be reproached for the name of christ happy are ye </string>
  <string> for the spirit of glory and of god resteth upon you on their part he is evil spoken of but on your part he is glorified</string>
  <string>
 but let none of you suffer as a murderer or as a thief or as an evildoer or as a busybody in other men's matters</string>
  <string>
 yet if any man suffer as a christian let him not be ashamed</string>
  <string> but let him glorify god on this behalf</string>
  <string>
 for the time is come that judgment must begin at the house of god and if it first begin at us what shall the end be of them that obey not the gospel of god</string>
  <string>
 if the righteous scarcely be saved where shall the ungodly and the sinner appear</string>
  <string>
 wherefore let them that suffer according to the will of god commit the keeping of their souls to him in well doing as unto a faithful creator</string>
  <string>
 
 the elders which are among you i exhort who am also an elder and a witness of the sufferings of christ and also a partaker of the glory that shall be revealed
 feed the flock of god which is among you taking the oversight thereof not by constraint but willingly</string>
  <string> not for filthy lucre but of a ready mind</string>
  <string>
 neither as being lords over god's heritage but being ensamples to the flock</string>
  <string>
 when the chief shepherd shall appear ye shall receive a crown of glory that fadeth not away</string>
  <string>
 likewise ye younger submit yourselves unto the elder</string>
  <string> yea all of you be subject one to another and be clothed with humility for god resisteth the proud and giveth grace to the humble</string>
  <string>
 humble yourselves therefore under the mighty hand of god that he may exalt you in due time
 casting all your care upon him</string>
  <string> for he careth for you</string>
  <string>
 be sober be vigilant</string>
  <string> because your adversary the devil as a roaring lion walketh about seeking whom he may devour
 whom resist stedfast in the faith knowing that the same afflictions are accomplished in your brethren that are in the world</string>
  <string>
 but the god of all grace who hath called us unto his eternal glory by christ jesus after that ye have suffered a while make you perfect stablish strengthen settle you </string>
  <string>
 to him be glory and dominion for ever and ever</string>
  <string> amen</string>
  <string>
 by silvanus a faithful brother unto you as i suppose i have written briefly exhorting and testifying that this is the true grace of god wherein ye stand</string>
  <string>
 the church that is at babylon elected together with you saluteth you</string>
  <string> and so doth marcus my son</string>
  <string>
 greet ye one another with a kiss of charity</string>
  <string> peace be with you all that are in christ jesus</string>
  <string> amen</string>
  <string>
 the second epistle general of peter
 
 simon peter a servant and an apostle of jesus christ to them that have obtained like precious faith with us through the righteousness of god and our saviour jesus christ
 grace and peace be multiplied unto you through the knowledge of god and of jesus our lord
 according as his divine power hath given unto us all things that pertain unto life and godliness through the knowledge of him that hath called us to glory and virtue
 whereby are given unto us exceeding great and precious promises that by these ye might be partakers of the divine nature having escaped the corruption that is in the world through lust</string>
  <string>
 beside this giving all diligence add to your faith virtue</string>
  <string> and to virtue knowledge</string>
  <string>
 to knowledge temperance</string>
  <string> and to temperance patience</string>
  <string> and to patience godliness</string>
  <string>
 to godliness brotherly kindness</string>
  <string> and to brotherly kindness charity</string>
  <string>
 for if these things be in you and abound they make you that ye shall neither be barren nor unfruitful in the knowledge of our lord jesus christ</string>
  <string>
 but he that lacketh these things is blind and cannot see afar off and hath forgotten that he was purged from his old sins</string>
  <string>
 wherefore the rather brethren give diligence to make your calling and election sure for if ye do these things ye shall never fall
 for so an entrance shall be ministered unto you abundantly into the everlasting kingdom of our lord and saviour jesus christ</string>
  <string>
 wherefore i will not be negligent to put you always in remembrance of these things though ye know them and be established in the present truth</string>
  <string>
 yea i think it meet as long as i am in this tabernacle to stir you up by putting you in remembrance</string>
  <string>
 knowing that shortly i must put off this my tabernacle even as our lord jesus christ hath shewed me</string>
  <string>
 moreover i will endeavour that ye may be able after my decease to have these things always in remembrance</string>
  <string>
 for we have not followed cunningly devised fables when we made known unto you the power and coming of our lord jesus christ but were eyewitnesses of his majesty</string>
  <string>
 for he received from god the father honour and glory when there came such a voice to him from the excellent glory this is my beloved son in whom i am well pleased</string>
  <string>
 this voice which came from heaven we heard when we were with him in the holy mount</string>
  <string>
 we have also a more sure word of prophecy</string>
  <string> whereunto ye do well that ye take heed as unto a light that shineth in a dark place until the day dawn and the day star arise in your hearts
 knowing this first that no prophecy of the scripture is of any private interpretation</string>
  <string>
 for the prophecy came not in old time by the will of man but holy men of god spake as they were moved by the holy ghost</string>
  <string>
 
 but there were false prophets also among the people even as there shall be false teachers among you who privily shall bring in damnable heresies even denying the lord that bought them and bring upon themselves swift destruction</string>
  <string>
 many shall follow their pernicious ways</string>
  <string> by reason of whom the way of truth shall be evil spoken of</string>
  <string>
 through covetousness shall they with feigned words make merchandise of you whose judgment now of a long time lingereth not and their damnation slumbereth not</string>
  <string>
 for if god spared not the angels that sinned but cast them down to hell and delivered them into chains of darkness to be reserved unto judgment</string>
  <string>
 spared not the old world but saved noah the eighth person a preacher of righteousness bringing in the flood upon the world of the ungodly</string>
  <string>
 turning the cities of sodom and gomorrha into ashes condemned them with an overthrow making them an ensample unto those that after should live ungodly</string>
  <string>
 delivered just lot vexed with the filthy conversation of the wicked
 for that righteous man dwelling among them in seeing and hearing vexed his righteous soul from day to day with their unlawful deeds</string>
  <string>
 the lord knoweth how to deliver the godly out of temptations and to reserve the unjust unto the day of judgment to be punished
 but chiefly them that walk after the flesh in the lust of uncleanness and despise government</string>
  <string> presumptuous are they selfwilled they are not afraid to speak evil of dignities</string>
  <string>
 whereas angels which are greater in power and might bring not railing accusation against them before the lord</string>
  <string>
 but these as natural brute beasts made to be taken and destroyed speak evil of the things that they understand not</string>
  <string> and shall utterly perish in their own corruption</string>
  <string>
 shall receive the reward of unrighteousness as they that count it pleasure to riot in the day time</string>
  <string> spots they are and blemishes sporting themselves with their own deceivings while they feast with you</string>
  <string>
 having eyes full of adultery and that cannot cease from sin</string>
  <string> beguiling unstable souls an heart they have exercised with covetous practices</string>
  <string> cursed children
 which have forsaken the right way and are gone astray following the way of balaam the son of bosor who loved the wages of unrighteousness</string>
  <string>
 but was rebuked for his iniquity the dumb ass speaking with man's voice forbad the madness of the prophet</string>
  <string>
 these are wells without water clouds that are carried with a tempest</string>
  <string> to whom the mist of darkness is reserved for ever</string>
  <string>
 for when they speak great swelling words of vanity they allure through the lusts of the flesh through much wantonness those that were clean escaped from them who live in error</string>
  <string>
 while they promise them liberty they themselves are the servants of corruption for of whom a man is overcome of the same is he brought in bondage</string>
  <string>
 for if after they have escaped the pollutions of the world through the knowledge of the lord and saviour jesus christ they are again entangled therein and overcome the latter end is worse with them than the beginning</string>
  <string>
 for it had been better for them not to have known the way of righteousness than after they have known it to turn from the holy commandment delivered unto them</string>
  <string>
 but it is happened unto them according to the true proverb the dog is turned to his own vomit again</string>
  <string> and the sow that was washed to her wallowing in the mire</string>
  <string>
 
 this second epistle beloved i now write unto you</string>
  <string> in both which i stir up your pure minds by way of remembrance
 that ye may be mindful of the words which were spoken before by the holy prophets and of the commandment of us the apostles of the lord and saviour
 knowing this first that there shall come in the last days scoffers walking after their own lusts
 saying where is the promise of his coming</string>
  <string> for since the fathers fell asleep all things continue as they were from the beginning of the creation</string>
  <string>
 for this they willingly are ignorant of that by the word of god the heavens were of old and the earth standing out of the water and in the water
 whereby the world that then was being overflowed with water perished
 but the heavens and the earth which are now by the same word are kept in store reserved unto fire against the day of judgment and perdition of ungodly men</string>
  <string>
 but beloved be not ignorant of this one thing that one day is with the lord as a thousand years and a thousand years as one day</string>
  <string>
 the lord is not slack concerning his promise as some men count slackness</string>
  <string> but is longsuffering to us-ward not willing that any should perish but that all should come to repentance</string>
  <string>
 but the day of the lord will come as a thief in the night</string>
  <string> in the which the heavens shall pass away with a great noise and the elements shall melt with fervent heat the earth also and the works that are therein shall be burned up</string>
  <string>
 seeing then that all these things shall be dissolved what manner of persons ought ye to be in all holy conversation and godliness
 looking for and hasting unto the coming of the day of god wherein the heavens being on fire shall be dissolved and the elements shall melt with fervent heat</string>
  <string>
 nevertheless we according to his promise look for new heavens and a new earth wherein dwelleth righteousness</string>
  <string>
 wherefore beloved seeing that ye look for such things be diligent that ye may be found of him in peace without spot and blameless</string>
  <string>
 account that the longsuffering of our lord is salvation</string>
  <string> even as our beloved brother paul also according to the wisdom given unto him hath written unto you</string>
  <string>
 as also in all his epistles speaking in them of these things</string>
  <string> in which are some things hard to be understood which they that are unlearned and unstable wrest as they do also the other scriptures unto their own destruction</string>
  <string>
 ye therefore beloved seeing ye know these things before beware lest ye also being led away with the error of the wicked fall from your own stedfastness</string>
  <string>
 but grow in grace and in the knowledge of our lord and saviour jesus christ</string>
  <string> to him be glory both now and for ever</string>
  <string> amen</string>
  <string>
 the first general epistle of john
 
 that which was from the beginning which we have heard which we have seen with our eyes which we have looked upon and our hands have handled of the word of life</string>
  <string>
 for the life was manifested and we have seen it and bear witness and shew unto you that eternal life which was with the father and was manifested unto us</string>
  <string>
 that which we have seen and heard declare we unto you that ye also may have fellowship with us and truly our fellowship is with the father and with his son jesus christ</string>
  <string>
 these things write we unto you that your joy may be full</string>
  <string>
 this then is the message which we have heard of him and declare unto you that god is light and in him is no darkness at all</string>
  <string>
 if we say that we have fellowship with him and walk in darkness we lie and do not the truth
 but if we walk in the light as he is in the light we have fellowship one with another and the blood of jesus christ his son cleanseth us from all sin</string>
  <string>
 if we say that we have no sin we deceive ourselves and the truth is not in us</string>
  <string>
 if we confess our sins he is faithful and just to forgive us our sins and to cleanse us from all unrighteousness</string>
  <string>
 if we say that we have not sinned we make him a liar and his word is not in us</string>
  <string>
 
 my little children these things write i unto you that ye sin not</string>
  <string> if any man sin we have an advocate with the father jesus christ the righteous
 he is the propitiation for our sins and not for our's only but also for the sins of the whole world</string>
  <string>
 hereby we do know that we know him if we keep his commandments</string>
  <string>
 he that saith i know him and keepeth not his commandments is a liar and the truth is not in him</string>
  <string>
 but whoso keepeth his word in him verily is the love of god perfected hereby know we that we are in him</string>
  <string>
 he that saith he abideth in him ought himself also so to walk even as he walked</string>
  <string>
 brethren i write no new commandment unto you but an old commandment which ye had from the beginning</string>
  <string> the old commandment is the word which ye have heard from the beginning</string>
  <string>
 again a new commandment i write unto you which thing is true in him and in you because the darkness is past and the true light now shineth</string>
  <string>
 he that saith he is in the light and hateth his brother is in darkness even until now</string>
  <string>
 he that loveth his brother abideth in the light and there is none occasion of stumbling in him</string>
  <string>
 but he that hateth his brother is in darkness and walketh in darkness and knoweth not whither he goeth because that darkness hath blinded his eyes</string>
  <string>
 i write unto you little children because your sins are forgiven you for his name's sake</string>
  <string>
 i write unto you fathers because ye have known him that is from the beginning</string>
  <string> i write unto you young men because ye have overcome the wicked one</string>
  <string> i write unto you little children because ye have known the father</string>
  <string>
 i have written unto you fathers because ye have known him that is from the beginning</string>
  <string> i have written unto you young men because ye are strong and the word of god abideth in you and ye have overcome the wicked one</string>
  <string>
 love not the world neither the things that are in the world</string>
  <string> if any man love the world the love of the father is not in him</string>
  <string>
 for all that is in the world the lust of the flesh and the lust of the eyes and the pride of life is not of the father but is of the world</string>
  <string>
 the world passeth away and the lust thereof but he that doeth the will of god abideth for ever</string>
  <string>
 little children it is the last time and as ye have heard that antichrist shall come even now are there many antichrists</string>
  <string> whereby we know that it is the last time</string>
  <string>
 they went out from us but they were not of us</string>
  <string> for if they had been of us they would no doubt have continued with us but they went out that they might be made manifest that they were not all of us</string>
  <string>
 but ye have an unction from the holy one and ye know all things</string>
  <string>
 i have not written unto you because ye know not the truth but because ye know it and that no lie is of the truth</string>
  <string>
 who is a liar but he that denieth that jesus is the christ</string>
  <string> he is antichrist that denieth the father and the son</string>
  <string>
 whosoever denieth the son the same hath not the father but he that acknowledgeth the son hath the father also </string>
  <string>
 let that therefore abide in you which ye have heard from the beginning</string>
  <string> if that which ye have heard from the beginning shall remain in you ye also shall continue in the son and in the father</string>
  <string>
 this is the promise that he hath promised us even eternal life</string>
  <string>
 these things have i written unto you concerning them that seduce you</string>
  <string>
 but the anointing which ye have received of him abideth in you and ye need not that any man teach you but as the same anointing teacheth you of all things and is truth and is no lie and even as it hath taught you ye shall abide in him</string>
  <string>
 now little children abide in him</string>
  <string> that when he shall appear we may have confidence and not be ashamed before him at his coming</string>
  <string>
 if ye know that he is righteous ye know that every one that doeth righteousness is born of him</string>
  <string>
 
 behold what manner of love the father hath bestowed upon us that we should be called the sons of god therefore the world knoweth us not because it knew him not</string>
  <string>
 beloved now are we the sons of god and it doth not yet appear what we shall be but we know that when he shall appear we shall be like him</string>
  <string> for we shall see him as he is</string>
  <string>
 every man that hath this hope in him purifieth himself even as he is pure</string>
  <string>
 whosoever committeth sin transgresseth also the law for sin is the transgression of the law</string>
  <string>
 ye know that he was manifested to take away our sins</string>
  <string> and in him is no sin</string>
  <string>
 whosoever abideth in him sinneth not whosoever sinneth hath not seen him neither known him</string>
  <string>
 little children let no man deceive you he that doeth righteousness is righteous even as he is righteous</string>
  <string>
 he that committeth sin is of the devil</string>
  <string> for the devil sinneth from the beginning</string>
  <string> for this purpose the son of god was manifested that he might destroy the works of the devil</string>
  <string>
 whosoever is born of god doth not commit sin</string>
  <string> for his seed remaineth in him and he cannot sin because he is born of god</string>
  <string>
 in this the children of god are manifest and the children of the devil whosoever doeth not righteousness is not of god neither he that loveth not his brother</string>
  <string>
 for this is the message that ye heard from the beginning that we should love one another</string>
  <string>
 not as cain who was of that wicked one and slew his brother</string>
  <string> wherefore slew he him</string>
  <string> because his own works were evil and his brother's righteous</string>
  <string>
 marvel not my brethren if the world hate you</string>
  <string>
 we know that we have passed from death unto life because we love the brethren</string>
  <string> he that loveth not his brother abideth in death</string>
  <string>
 whosoever hateth his brother is a murderer and ye know that no murderer hath eternal life abiding in him</string>
  <string>
 hereby perceive we the love of god because he laid down his life for us and we ought to lay down our lives for the brethren</string>
  <string>
 but whoso hath this world's good and seeth his brother have need and shutteth up his bowels of compassion from him how dwelleth the love of god in him</string>
  <string>
 my little children let us not love in word neither in tongue</string>
  <string> but in deed and in truth</string>
  <string>
 hereby we know that we are of the truth and shall assure our hearts before him</string>
  <string>
 for if our heart condemn us god is greater than our heart and knoweth all things</string>
  <string>
 beloved if our heart condemn us not then have we confidence toward god</string>
  <string>
 whatsoever we ask we receive of him because we keep his commandments and do those things that are pleasing in his sight</string>
  <string>
 this is his commandment that we should believe on the name of his son jesus christ and love one another as he gave us commandment</string>
  <string>
 he that keepeth his commandments dwelleth in him and he in him</string>
  <string> hereby we know that he abideth in us by the spirit which he hath given us</string>
  <string>
 
 beloved believe not every spirit but try the spirits whether they are of god because many false prophets are gone out into the world</string>
  <string>
 hereby know ye the spirit of god every spirit that confesseth that jesus christ is come in the flesh is of god
 every spirit that confesseth not that jesus christ is come in the flesh is not of god and this is that spirit of antichrist whereof ye have heard that it should come</string>
  <string> and even now already is it in the world</string>
  <string>
 ye are of god little children and have overcome them because greater is he that is in you than he that is in the world</string>
  <string>
 they are of the world therefore speak they of the world and the world heareth them</string>
  <string>
 we are of god he that knoweth god heareth us</string>
  <string> he that is not of god heareth not us</string>
  <string> hereby know we the spirit of truth and the spirit of error</string>
  <string>
 beloved let us love one another for love is of god</string>
  <string> and every one that loveth is born of god and knoweth god</string>
  <string>
 he that loveth not knoweth not god</string>
  <string> for god is love</string>
  <string>
 in this was manifested the love of god toward us because that god sent his only begotten son into the world that we might live through him</string>
  <string>
 herein is love not that we loved god but that he loved us and sent his son to be the propitiation for our sins</string>
  <string>
 beloved if god so loved us we ought also to love one another</string>
  <string>
 no man hath seen god at any time</string>
  <string> if we love one another god dwelleth in us and his love is perfected in us</string>
  <string>
 hereby know we that we dwell in him and he in us because he hath given us of his spirit</string>
  <string>
 we have seen and do testify that the father sent the son to be the saviour of the world</string>
  <string>
 whosoever shall confess that jesus is the son of god god dwelleth in him and he in god</string>
  <string>
 we have known and believed the love that god hath to us</string>
  <string> god is love</string>
  <string> and he that dwelleth in love dwelleth in god and god in him</string>
  <string>
 herein is our love made perfect that we may have boldness in the day of judgment because as he is so are we in this world</string>
  <string>
 there is no fear in love</string>
  <string> but perfect love casteth out fear because fear hath torment</string>
  <string> he that feareth is not made perfect in love</string>
  <string>
 we love him because he first loved us</string>
  <string>
 if a man say i love god and hateth his brother he is a liar for he that loveth not his brother whom he hath seen how can he love god whom he hath not seen</string>
  <string>
 this commandment have we from him that he who loveth god love his brother also</string>
  <string>
 
 whosoever believeth that jesus is the christ is born of god and every one that loveth him that begat loveth him also that is begotten of him</string>
  <string>
 by this we know that we love the children of god when we love god and keep his commandments</string>
  <string>
 for this is the love of god that we keep his commandments and his commandments are not grievous</string>
  <string>
 for whatsoever is born of god overcometh the world and this is the victory that overcometh the world even our faith</string>
  <string>
 who is he that overcometh the world but he that believeth that jesus is the son of god</string>
  <string>
 this is he that came by water and blood even jesus christ</string>
  <string> not by water only but by water and blood</string>
  <string> it is the spirit that beareth witness because the spirit is truth</string>
  <string>
 for there are three that bear record in heaven the father the word and the holy ghost and these three are one</string>
  <string>
 there are three that bear witness in earth the spirit and the water and the blood and these three agree in one</string>
  <string>
 if we receive the witness of men the witness of god is greater for this is the witness of god which he hath testified of his son</string>
  <string>
 he that believeth on the son of god hath the witness in himself he that believeth not god hath made him a liar</string>
  <string> because he believeth not the record that god gave of his son</string>
  <string>
 this is the record that god hath given to us eternal life and this life is in his son</string>
  <string>
 he that hath the son hath life</string>
  <string> and he that hath not the son of god hath not life</string>
  <string>
 these things have i written unto you that believe on the name of the son of god</string>
  <string> that ye may know that ye have eternal life and that ye may believe on the name of the son of god</string>
  <string>
 this is the confidence that we have in him that if we ask any thing according to his will he heareth us
 if we know that he hear us whatsoever we ask we know that we have the petitions that we desired of him</string>
  <string>
 if any man see his brother sin a sin which is not unto death he shall ask and he shall give him life for them that sin not unto death</string>
  <string> there is a sin unto death i do not say that he shall pray for it</string>
  <string>
 all unrighteousness is sin and there is a sin not unto death</string>
  <string>
 we know that whosoever is born of god sinneth not</string>
  <string> but he that is begotten of god keepeth himself and that wicked one toucheth him not</string>
  <string>
 we know that we are of god and the whole world lieth in wickedness</string>
  <string>
 we know that the son of god is come and hath given us an understanding that we may know him that is true and we are in him that is true even in his son jesus christ</string>
  <string> this is the true god and eternal life</string>
  <string>
 little children keep yourselves from idols</string>
  <string> amen</string>
  <string>
 the second epistle of john
 
 the elder unto the elect lady and her children whom i love in the truth</string>
  <string> and not i only but also all they that have known the truth</string>
  <string>
 for the truth's sake which dwelleth in us and shall be with us for ever</string>
  <string>
 grace be with you mercy and peace from god the father and from the lord jesus christ the son of the father in truth and love</string>
  <string>
 i rejoiced greatly that i found of thy children walking in truth as we have received a commandment from the father</string>
  <string>
 now i beseech thee lady not as though i wrote a new commandment unto thee but that which we had from the beginning that we love one another</string>
  <string>
 this is love that we walk after his commandments</string>
  <string> this is the commandment that as ye have heard from the beginning ye should walk in it</string>
  <string>
 for many deceivers are entered into the world who confess not that jesus christ is come in the flesh</string>
  <string> this is a deceiver and an antichrist</string>
  <string>
 look to yourselves that we lose not those things which we have wrought but that we receive a full reward</string>
  <string>
 whosoever transgresseth and abideth not in the doctrine of christ hath not god</string>
  <string> he that abideth in the doctrine of christ he hath both the father and the son</string>
  <string>
 if there come any unto you and bring not this doctrine receive him not into your house neither bid him god speed
 for he that biddeth him god speed is partaker of his evil deeds</string>
  <string>
 having many things to write unto you i would not write with paper and ink but i trust to come unto you and speak face to face that our joy may be full</string>
  <string>
 the children of thy elect sister greet thee</string>
  <string> amen</string>
  <string>
 the third epistle of john
 
 the elder unto the wellbeloved gaius whom i love in the truth</string>
  <string>
 beloved i wish above all things that thou mayest prosper and be in health even as thy soul prospereth</string>
  <string>
 for i rejoiced greatly when the brethren came and testified of the truth that is in thee even as thou walkest in the truth</string>
  <string>
 i have no greater joy than to hear that my children walk in truth</string>
  <string>
 beloved thou doest faithfully whatsoever thou doest to the brethren and to strangers</string>
  <string>
 which have borne witness of thy charity before the church whom if thou bring forward on their journey after a godly sort thou shalt do well
 because that for his name's sake they went forth taking nothing of the gentiles</string>
  <string>
 we therefore ought to receive such that we might be fellowhelpers to the truth</string>
  <string>
 i wrote unto the church but diotrephes who loveth to have the preeminence among them receiveth us not</string>
  <string>
 wherefore if i come i will remember his deeds which he doeth prating against us with malicious words and not content therewith neither doth he himself receive the brethren and forbiddeth them that would and casteth them out of the church</string>
  <string>
 beloved follow not that which is evil but that which is good</string>
  <string> he that doeth good is of god but he that doeth evil hath not seen god</string>
  <string>
 demetrius hath good report of all men and of the truth itself yea and we also bear record</string>
  <string> and ye know that our record is true</string>
  <string>
 i had many things to write but i will not with ink and pen write unto thee
 but i trust i shall shortly see thee and we shall speak face to face</string>
  <string> peace be to thee</string>
  <string> our friends salute thee</string>
  <string> greet the friends by name</string>
  <string>
 the general epistle of jude
 
 jude the servant of jesus christ and brother of james to them that are sanctified by god the father and preserved in jesus christ and called
 mercy unto you and peace and love be multiplied</string>
  <string>
 beloved when i gave all diligence to write unto you of the common salvation it was needful for me to write unto you and exhort you that ye should earnestly contend for the faith which was once delivered unto the saints</string>
  <string>
 for there are certain men crept in unawares who were before of old ordained to this condemnation ungodly men turning the grace of our god into lasciviousness and denying the only lord god and our lord jesus christ</string>
  <string>
 i will therefore put you in remembrance though ye once knew this how that the lord having saved the people out of the land of egypt afterward destroyed them that believed not</string>
  <string>
 the angels which kept not their first estate but left their own habitation he hath reserved in everlasting chains under darkness unto the judgment of the great day</string>
  <string>
 even as sodom and gomorrha and the cities about them in like manner giving themselves over to fornication and going after strange flesh are set forth for an example suffering the vengeance of eternal fire</string>
  <string>
 likewise also these filthy dreamers defile the flesh despise dominion and speak evil of dignities</string>
  <string>
 yet michael the archangel when contending with the devil he disputed about the body of moses durst not bring against him a railing accusation but said the lord rebuke thee</string>
  <string>
 but these speak evil of those things which they know not but what they know naturally as brute beasts in those things they corrupt themselves</string>
  <string>
 woe unto them</string>
  <string> for they have gone in the way of cain and ran greedily after the error of balaam for reward and perished in the gainsaying of core</string>
  <string>
 these are spots in your feasts of charity when they feast with you feeding themselves without fear clouds they are without water carried about of winds</string>
  <string> trees whose fruit withereth without fruit twice dead plucked up by the roots</string>
  <string>
 raging waves of the sea foaming out their own shame</string>
  <string> wandering stars to whom is reserved the blackness of darkness for ever</string>
  <string>
 enoch also the seventh from adam prophesied of these saying behold the lord cometh with ten thousands of his saints
 to execute judgment upon all and to convince all that are ungodly among them of all their ungodly deeds which they have ungodly committed and of all their hard speeches which ungodly sinners have spoken against him</string>
  <string>
 these are murmurers complainers walking after their own lusts</string>
  <string> and their mouth speaketh great swelling words having men's persons in admiration because of advantage</string>
  <string>
 but beloved remember ye the words which were spoken before of the apostles of our lord jesus christ</string>
  <string>
 how that they told you there should be mockers in the last time who should walk after their own ungodly lusts</string>
  <string>
 these be they who separate themselves sensual having not the spirit</string>
  <string>
 but ye beloved building up yourselves on your most holy faith praying in the holy ghost
 keep yourselves in the love of god looking for the mercy of our lord jesus christ unto eternal life</string>
  <string>
 of some have compassion making a difference
 others save with fear pulling them out of the fire</string>
  <string> hating even the garment spotted by the flesh</string>
  <string>
 now unto him that is able to keep you from falling and to present you faultless before the presence of his glory with exceeding joy
 to the only wise god our saviour be glory and majesty dominion and power both now and ever</string>
  <string> amen</string>
  <string>
 the revelation of saint john the divine
 
 the revelation of jesus christ which god gave unto him to shew unto his servants things which must shortly come to pass</string>
  <string> and he sent and signified it by his angel unto his servant john
 who bare record of the word of god and of the testimony of jesus christ and of all things that he saw</string>
  <string>
 blessed is he that readeth and they that hear the words of this prophecy and keep those things which are written therein for the time is at hand</string>
  <string>
 john to the seven churches which are in asia grace be unto you and peace from him which is and which was and which is to come</string>
  <string> and from the seven spirits which are before his throne</string>
  <string>
 from jesus christ who is the faithful witness and the first begotten of the dead and the prince of the kings of the earth</string>
  <string> unto him that loved us and washed us from our sins in his own blood
 hath made us kings and priests unto god and his father</string>
  <string> to him be glory and dominion for ever and ever</string>
  <string> amen</string>
  <string>
 behold he cometh with clouds</string>
  <string> and every eye shall see him and they also which pierced him and all kindreds of the earth shall wail because of him</string>
  <string> even so amen</string>
  <string>
 i am alpha and omega the beginning and the ending saith the lord which is and which was and which is to come the almighty</string>
  <string>
 i john who also am your brother and companion in tribulation and in the kingdom and patience of jesus christ was in the isle that is called patmos for the word of god and for the testimony of jesus christ</string>
  <string>
 i was in the spirit on the lord's day and heard behind me a great voice as of a trumpet
 saying i am alpha and omega the first and the last and what thou seest write in a book and send it unto the seven churches which are in asia</string>
  <string> unto ephesus and unto smyrna and unto pergamos and unto thyatira and unto sardis and unto philadelphia and unto laodicea</string>
  <string>
 i turned to see the voice that spake with me</string>
  <string> being turned i saw seven golden candlesticks</string>
  <string>
 in the midst of the seven candlesticks one like unto the son of man clothed with a garment down to the foot and girt about the paps with a golden girdle</string>
  <string>
 his head and his hairs were white like wool as white as snow</string>
  <string> and his eyes were as a flame of fire</string>
  <string>
 his feet like unto fine brass as if they burned in a furnace</string>
  <string> and his voice as the sound of many waters</string>
  <string>
 he had in his right hand seven stars and out of his mouth went a sharp twoedged sword and his countenance was as the sun shineth in his strength</string>
  <string>
 when i saw him i fell at his feet as dead</string>
  <string> he laid his right hand upon me saying unto me fear not</string>
  <string> i am the first and the last
 i am he that liveth and was dead</string>
  <string> and behold i am alive for evermore amen</string>
  <string> and have the keys of hell and of death</string>
  <string>
 write the things which thou hast seen and the things which are and the things which shall be hereafter</string>
  <string>
 the mystery of the seven stars which thou sawest in my right hand and the seven golden candlesticks</string>
  <string> the seven stars are the angels of the seven churches and the seven candlesticks which thou sawest are the seven churches</string>
  <string>
 
 unto the angel of the church of ephesus write</string>
  <string> these things saith he that holdeth the seven stars in his right hand who walketh in the midst of the seven golden candlesticks</string>
  <string>
 i know thy works and thy labour and thy patience and how thou canst not bear them which are evil and thou hast tried them which say they are apostles and are not and hast found them liars
 hast borne and hast patience and for my name's sake hast laboured and hast not fainted</string>
  <string>
 nevertheless i have somewhat against thee because thou hast left thy first love</string>
  <string>
 remember therefore from whence thou art fallen and repent and do the first works</string>
  <string> or else i will come unto thee quickly and will remove thy candlestick out of his place except thou repent</string>
  <string>
 but this thou hast that thou hatest the deeds of the nicolaitans which i also hate</string>
  <string>
 he that hath an ear let him hear what the spirit saith unto the churches</string>
  <string> to him that overcometh will i give to eat of the tree of life which is in the midst of the paradise of god</string>
  <string>
 unto the angel of the church in smyrna write</string>
  <string> these things saith the first and the last which was dead and is alive</string>
  <string>
 i know thy works and tribulation and poverty but thou art rich and i know the blasphemy of them which say they are jews and are not but are the synagogue of satan</string>
  <string>
 fear none of those things which thou shalt suffer behold the devil shall cast some of you into prison that ye may be tried</string>
  <string> and ye shall have tribulation ten days be thou faithful unto death and i will give thee a crown of life</string>
  <string>
 he that hath an ear let him hear what the spirit saith unto the churches</string>
  <string> he that overcometh shall not be hurt of the second death</string>
  <string>
 to the angel of the church in pergamos write</string>
  <string> these things saith he which hath the sharp sword with two edges</string>
  <string>
 i know thy works and where thou dwellest even where satan's seat is  and thou holdest fast my name and hast not denied my faith even in those days wherein antipas was my faithful martyr who was slain among you where satan dwelleth</string>
  <string>
 but i have a few things against thee because thou hast there them that hold the doctrine of balaam who taught balac to cast a stumblingblock before the children of israel to eat things sacrificed unto idols and to commit fornication</string>
  <string>
 so hast thou also them that hold the doctrine of the nicolaitans which thing i hate</string>
  <string>
 repent</string>
  <string> or else i will come unto thee quickly and will fight against them with the sword of my mouth</string>
  <string>
 he that hath an ear let him hear what the spirit saith unto the churches</string>
  <string> to him that overcometh will i give to eat of the hidden manna and will give him a white stone and in the stone a new name written which no man knoweth saving he that receiveth it </string>
  <string>
 unto the angel of the church in thyatira write</string>
  <string> these things saith the son of god who hath his eyes like unto a flame of fire and his feet are like fine brass</string>
  <string>
 i know thy works and charity and service and faith and thy patience and thy works</string>
  <string> and the last to be more than the first</string>
  <string>
 notwithstanding i have a few things against thee because thou sufferest that woman jezebel which calleth herself a prophetess to teach and to seduce my servants to commit fornication and to eat things sacrificed unto idols</string>
  <string>
 i gave her space to repent of her fornication</string>
  <string> and she repented not</string>
  <string>
 behold i will cast her into a bed and them that commit adultery with her into great tribulation except they repent of their deeds</string>
  <string>
 i will kill her children with death</string>
  <string> and all the churches shall know that i am he which searcheth the reins and hearts and i will give unto every one of you according to your works</string>
  <string>
 but unto you i say and unto the rest in thyatira as many as have not this doctrine and which have not known the depths of satan as they speak</string>
  <string> i will put upon you none other burden</string>
  <string>
 but that which ye have already hold fast till i come</string>
  <string>
 he that overcometh and keepeth my works unto the end to him will i give power over the nations
 he shall rule them with a rod of iron</string>
  <string> as the vessels of a potter shall they be broken to shivers even as i received of my father</string>
  <string>
 i will give him the morning star</string>
  <string>
 he that hath an ear let him hear what the spirit saith unto the churches</string>
  <string>
 
 unto the angel of the church in sardis write</string>
  <string> these things saith he that hath the seven spirits of god and the seven stars</string>
  <string> i know thy works that thou hast a name that thou livest and art dead</string>
  <string>
 be watchful and strengthen the things which remain that are ready to die for i have not found thy works perfect before god</string>
  <string>
 remember therefore how thou hast received and heard and hold fast and repent</string>
  <string> if therefore thou shalt not watch i will come on thee as a thief and thou shalt not know what hour i will come upon thee</string>
  <string>
 thou hast a few names even in sardis which have not defiled their garments</string>
  <string> and they shall walk with me in white for they are worthy</string>
  <string>
 he that overcometh the same shall be clothed in white raiment</string>
  <string> and i will not blot out his name out of the book of life but i will confess his name before my father and before his angels</string>
  <string>
 he that hath an ear let him hear what the spirit saith unto the churches</string>
  <string>
 to the angel of the church in philadelphia write</string>
  <string> these things saith he that is holy he that is true he that hath the key of david he that openeth and no man shutteth</string>
  <string> and shutteth and no man openeth</string>
  <string>
 i know thy works behold i have set before thee an open door and no man can shut it for thou hast a little strength and hast kept my word and hast not denied my name</string>
  <string>
 behold i will make them of the synagogue of satan which say they are jews and are not but do lie</string>
  <string> behold i will make them to come and worship before thy feet and to know that i have loved thee</string>
  <string>
 because thou hast kept the word of my patience i also will keep thee from the hour of temptation which shall come upon all the world to try them that dwell upon the earth</string>
  <string>
 behold i come quickly hold that fast which thou hast that no man take thy crown</string>
  <string>
 him that overcometh will i make a pillar in the temple of my god and he shall go no more out and i will write upon him the name of my god and the name of the city of my god which is new jerusalem which cometh down out of heaven from my god and i will write upon him my new name</string>
  <string>
 he that hath an ear let him hear what the spirit saith unto the churches</string>
  <string>
 unto the angel of the church of the laodiceans write</string>
  <string> these things saith the amen the faithful and true witness the beginning of the creation of god</string>
  <string>
 i know thy works that thou art neither cold nor hot i would thou wert cold or hot</string>
  <string>
 so then because thou art lukewarm and neither cold nor hot i will spue thee out of my mouth</string>
  <string>
 because thou sayest i am rich and increased with goods and have need of nothing</string>
  <string> and knowest not that thou art wretched and miserable and poor and blind and naked
 i counsel thee to buy of me gold tried in the fire that thou mayest be rich</string>
  <string> and white raiment that thou mayest be clothed and that the shame of thy nakedness do not appear</string>
  <string> and anoint thine eyes with eyesalve that thou mayest see</string>
  <string>
 as many as i love i rebuke and chasten be zealous therefore and repent</string>
  <string>
 behold i stand at the door and knock if any man hear my voice and open the door i will come in to him and will sup with him and he with me</string>
  <string>
 to him that overcometh will i grant to sit with me in my throne even as i also overcame and am set down with my father in his throne</string>
  <string>
 he that hath an ear let him hear what the spirit saith unto the churches</string>
  <string>
 
 after this i looked and behold a door was opened in heaven and the first voice which i heard was as it were of a trumpet talking with me</string>
  <string> which said come up hither and i will shew thee things which must be hereafter</string>
  <string>
 immediately i was in the spirit and behold a throne was set in heaven and one sat on the throne</string>
  <string>
 he that sat was to look upon like a jasper and a sardine stone and there was a rainbow round about the throne in sight like unto an emerald</string>
  <string>
 round about the throne were four and twenty seats and upon the seats i saw four and twenty elders sitting clothed in white raiment</string>
  <string> and they had on their heads crowns of gold</string>
  <string>
 out of the throne proceeded lightnings and thunderings and voices and there were seven lamps of fire burning before the throne which are the seven spirits of god</string>
  <string>
 before the throne there was a sea of glass like unto crystal and in the midst of the throne and round about the throne were four beasts full of eyes before and behind</string>
  <string>
 the first beast was like a lion and the second beast like a calf and the third beast had a face as a man and the fourth beast was like a flying eagle</string>
  <string>
 the four beasts had each of them six wings about him </string>
  <string> and they were full of eyes within and they rest not day and night saying holy holy holy lord god almighty which was and is and is to come</string>
  <string>
 when those beasts give glory and honour and thanks to him that sat on the throne who liveth for ever and ever
 the four and twenty elders fall down before him that sat on the throne and worship him that liveth for ever and ever and cast their crowns before the throne saying
 thou art worthy o lord to receive glory and honour and power for thou hast created all things and for thy pleasure they are and were created</string>
  <string>
 
 i saw in the right hand of him that sat on the throne a book written within and on the backside sealed with seven seals</string>
  <string>
 i saw a strong angel proclaiming with a loud voice who is worthy to open the book and to loose the seals thereof</string>
  <string>
 no man in heaven nor in earth neither under the earth was able to open the book neither to look thereon</string>
  <string>
 i wept much because no man was found worthy to open and to read the book neither to look thereon</string>
  <string>
 one of the elders saith unto me weep not behold the lion of the tribe of juda the root of david hath prevailed to open the book and to loose the seven seals thereof</string>
  <string>
 i beheld and lo in the midst of the throne and of the four beasts and in the midst of the elders stood a lamb as it had been slain having seven horns and seven eyes which are the seven spirits of god sent forth into all the earth</string>
  <string>
 he came and took the book out of the right hand of him that sat upon the throne</string>
  <string>
 when he had taken the book the four beasts and four and twenty elders fell down before the lamb having every one of them harps and golden vials full of odours which are the prayers of saints</string>
  <string>
 they sung a new song saying thou art worthy to take the book and to open the seals thereof for thou wast slain and hast redeemed us to god by thy blood out of every kindred and tongue and people and nation</string>
  <string>
 hast made us unto our god kings and priests and we shall reign on the earth</string>
  <string>
 i beheld and i heard the voice of many angels round about the throne and the beasts and the elders and the number of them was ten thousand times ten thousand and thousands of thousands</string>
  <string>
 saying with a loud voice worthy is the lamb that was slain to receive power and riches and wisdom and strength and honour and glory and blessing</string>
  <string>
 every creature which is in heaven and on the earth and under the earth and such as are in the sea and all that are in them heard i saying blessing and honour and glory and power be unto him that sitteth upon the throne and unto the lamb for ever and ever</string>
  <string>
 the four beasts said amen</string>
  <string> the four and twenty elders fell down and worshipped him that liveth for ever and ever</string>
  <string>
 
 i saw when the lamb opened one of the seals and i heard as it were the noise of thunder one of the four beasts saying come and see</string>
  <string>
 i saw and behold a white horse and he that sat on him had a bow</string>
  <string> and a crown was given unto him and he went forth conquering and to conquer</string>
  <string>
 when he had opened the second seal i heard the second beast say come and see</string>
  <string>
 there went out another horse that was red and power was given to him that sat thereon to take peace from the earth and that they should kill one another and there was given unto him a great sword</string>
  <string>
 when he had opened the third seal i heard the third beast say come and see</string>
  <string> i beheld and lo a black horse</string>
  <string> and he that sat on him had a pair of balances in his hand</string>
  <string>
 i heard a voice in the midst of the four beasts say a measure of wheat for a penny and three measures of barley for a penny</string>
  <string> and see thou hurt not the oil and the wine</string>
  <string>
 when he had opened the fourth seal i heard the voice of the fourth beast say come and see</string>
  <string>
 i looked and behold a pale horse and his name that sat on him was death and hell followed with him</string>
  <string> power was given unto them over the fourth part of the earth to kill with sword and with hunger and with death and with the beasts of the earth</string>
  <string>
 when he had opened the fifth seal i saw under the altar the souls of them that were slain for the word of god and for the testimony which they held
 they cried with a loud voice saying how long o lord holy and true dost thou not judge and avenge our blood on them that dwell on the earth</string>
  <string>
 white robes were given unto every one of them</string>
  <string> and it was said unto them that they should rest yet for a little season until their fellowservants also and their brethren that should be killed as they were should be fulfilled</string>
  <string>
 i beheld when he had opened the sixth seal and lo there was a great earthquake</string>
  <string> and the sun became black as sackcloth of hair and the moon became as blood</string>
  <string>
 the stars of heaven fell unto the earth even as a fig tree casteth her untimely figs when she is shaken of a mighty wind</string>
  <string>
 the heaven departed as a scroll when it is rolled together</string>
  <string> and every mountain and island were moved out of their places</string>
  <string>
 the kings of the earth and the great men and the rich men and the chief captains and the mighty men and every bondman and every free man hid themselves in the dens and in the rocks of the mountains</string>
  <string>
 said to the mountains and rocks fall on us and hide us from the face of him that sitteth on the throne and from the wrath of the lamb
 for the great day of his wrath is come</string>
  <string> and who shall be able to stand</string>
  <string>
 
 after these things i saw four angels standing on the four corners of the earth holding the four winds of the earth that the wind should not blow on the earth nor on the sea nor on any tree</string>
  <string>
 i saw another angel ascending from the east having the seal of the living god and he cried with a loud voice to the four angels to whom it was given to hurt the earth and the sea
 saying hurt not the earth neither the sea nor the trees till we have sealed the servants of our god in their foreheads</string>
  <string>
 i heard the number of them which were sealed and there were sealed an hundred and forty and four thousand of all the tribes of the children of israel</string>
  <string>
 of the tribe of juda were sealed twelve thousand</string>
  <string> of the tribe of reuben were sealed twelve thousand</string>
  <string> of the tribe of gad were sealed twelve thousand</string>
  <string>
 of the tribe of aser were sealed twelve thousand</string>
  <string> of the tribe of nepthalim were sealed twelve thousand</string>
  <string> of the tribe of manasses were sealed twelve thousand</string>
  <string>
 of the tribe of simeon were sealed twelve thousand</string>
  <string> of the tribe of levi were sealed twelve thousand</string>
  <string> of the tribe of issachar were sealed twelve thousand</string>
  <string>
 of the tribe of zabulon were sealed twelve thousand</string>
  <string> of the tribe of joseph were sealed twelve thousand</string>
  <string> of the tribe of benjamin were sealed twelve thousand</string>
  <string>
 after this i beheld and lo a great multitude which no man could number of all nations and kindreds and people and tongues stood before the throne and before the lamb clothed with white robes and palms in their hands</string>
  <string>
 cried with a loud voice saying salvation to our god which sitteth upon the throne and unto the lamb</string>
  <string>
 all the angels stood round about the throne and about the elders and the four beasts and fell before the throne on their faces and worshipped god
 saying amen blessing and glory and wisdom and thanksgiving and honour and power and might be unto our god for ever and ever</string>
  <string> amen</string>
  <string>
 one of the elders answered saying unto me what are these which are arrayed in white robes</string>
  <string> and whence came they</string>
  <string>
 i said unto him sir thou knowest</string>
  <string> he said to me these are they which came out of great tribulation and have washed their robes and made them white in the blood of the lamb</string>
  <string>
 therefore are they before the throne of god and serve him day and night in his temple and he that sitteth on the throne shall dwell among them</string>
  <string>
 they shall hunger no more neither thirst any more</string>
  <string> neither shall the sun light on them nor any heat</string>
  <string>
 for the lamb which is in the midst of the throne shall feed them and shall lead them unto living fountains of waters and god shall wipe away all tears from their eyes</string>
  <string>
 
 when he had opened the seventh seal there was silence in heaven about the space of half an hour</string>
  <string>
 i saw the seven angels which stood before god</string>
  <string> and to them were given seven trumpets</string>
  <string>
 another angel came and stood at the altar having a golden censer</string>
  <string> and there was given unto him much incense that he should offer it with the prayers of all saints upon the golden altar which was before the throne</string>
  <string>
 the smoke of the incense which came with the prayers of the saints ascended up before god out of the angel's hand</string>
  <string>
 the angel took the censer and filled it with fire of the altar and cast it into the earth and there were voices and thunderings and lightnings and an earthquake</string>
  <string>
 the seven angels which had the seven trumpets prepared themselves to sound</string>
  <string>
 the first angel sounded and there followed hail and fire mingled with blood and they were cast upon the earth and the third part of trees was burnt up and all green grass was burnt up</string>
  <string>
 the second angel sounded and as it were a great mountain burning with fire was cast into the sea and the third part of the sea became blood</string>
  <string>
 the third part of the creatures which were in the sea and had life died</string>
  <string> and the third part of the ships were destroyed</string>
  <string>
 the third angel sounded and there fell a great star from heaven burning as it were a lamp and it fell upon the third part of the rivers and upon the fountains of waters</string>
  <string>
 the name of the star is called wormwood and the third part of the waters became wormwood</string>
  <string> and many men died of the waters because they were made bitter</string>
  <string>
 the fourth angel sounded and the third part of the sun was smitten and the third part of the moon and the third part of the stars</string>
  <string> so as the third part of them was darkened and the day shone not for a third part of it and the night likewise</string>
  <string>
 i beheld and heard an angel flying through the midst of heaven saying with a loud voice woe woe woe to the inhabiters of the earth by reason of the other voices of the trumpet of the three angels which are yet to sound</string>
  <string>
 
 the fifth angel sounded and i saw a star fall from heaven unto the earth and to him was given the key of the bottomless pit</string>
  <string>
 he opened the bottomless pit</string>
  <string> and there arose a smoke out of the pit as the smoke of a great furnace</string>
  <string> and the sun and the air were darkened by reason of the smoke of the pit</string>
  <string>
 there came out of the smoke locusts upon the earth and unto them was given power as the scorpions of the earth have power</string>
  <string>
 it was commanded them that they should not hurt the grass of the earth neither any green thing neither any tree</string>
  <string> but only those men which have not the seal of god in their foreheads</string>
  <string>
 to them it was given that they should not kill them but that they should be tormented five months and their torment was as the torment of a scorpion when he striketh a man</string>
  <string>
 in those days shall men seek death and shall not find it</string>
  <string> and shall desire to die and death shall flee from them</string>
  <string>
 the shapes of the locusts were like unto horses prepared unto battle</string>
  <string> and on their heads were as it were crowns like gold and their faces were as the faces of men</string>
  <string>
 they had hair as the hair of women and their teeth were as the teeth of lions</string>
  <string>
 they had breastplates as it were breastplates of iron</string>
  <string> and the sound of their wings was as the sound of chariots of many horses running to battle</string>
  <string>
 they had tails like unto scorpions and there were stings in their tails and their power was to hurt men five months</string>
  <string>
 they had a king over them which is the angel of the bottomless pit whose name in the hebrew tongue is abaddon but in the greek tongue hath his name apollyon</string>
  <string>
 one woe is past</string>
  <string> and behold there come two woes more hereafter</string>
  <string>
 the sixth angel sounded and i heard a voice from the four horns of the golden altar which is before god
 saying to the sixth angel which had the trumpet loose the four angels which are bound in the great river euphrates</string>
  <string>
 the four angels were loosed which were prepared for an hour and a day and a month and a year for to slay the third part of men</string>
  <string>
 the number of the army of the horsemen were two hundred thousand thousand and i heard the number of them</string>
  <string>
 thus i saw the horses in the vision and them that sat on them having breastplates of fire and of jacinth and brimstone and the heads of the horses were as the heads of lions</string>
  <string> and out of their mouths issued fire and smoke and brimstone</string>
  <string>
 by these three was the third part of men killed by the fire and by the smoke and by the brimstone which issued out of their mouths</string>
  <string>
 for their power is in their mouth and in their tails for their tails were like unto serpents and had heads and with them they do hurt</string>
  <string>
 the rest of the men which were not killed by these plagues yet repented not of the works of their hands that they should not worship devils and idols of gold and silver and brass and stone and of wood which neither can see nor hear nor walk
 neither repented they of their murders nor of their sorceries nor of their fornication nor of their thefts</string>
  <string>
 
 i saw another mighty angel come down from heaven clothed with a cloud and a rainbow was upon his head and his face was as it were the sun and his feet as pillars of fire
 he had in his hand a little book open and he set his right foot upon the sea and his left foot on the earth
 cried with a loud voice as when a lion roareth and when he had cried seven thunders uttered their voices</string>
  <string>
 when the seven thunders had uttered their voices i was about to write and i heard a voice from heaven saying unto me seal up those things which the seven thunders uttered and write them not</string>
  <string>
 the angel which i saw stand upon the sea and upon the earth lifted up his hand to heaven
 sware by him that liveth for ever and ever who created heaven and the things that therein are and the earth and the things that therein are and the sea and the things which are therein that there should be time no longer
 but in the days of the voice of the seventh angel when he shall begin to sound the mystery of god should be finished as he hath declared to his servants the prophets</string>
  <string>
 the voice which i heard from heaven spake unto me again and said go and take the little book which is open in the hand of the angel which standeth upon the sea and upon the earth</string>
  <string>
 i went unto the angel and said unto him give me the little book</string>
  <string> he said unto me take it and eat it up</string>
  <string> and it shall make thy belly bitter but it shall be in thy mouth sweet as honey</string>
  <string>
 i took the little book out of the angel's hand and ate it up</string>
  <string> and it was in my mouth sweet as honey and as soon as i had eaten it my belly was bitter</string>
  <string>
 he said unto me thou must prophesy again before many peoples and nations and tongues and kings</string>
  <string>
 
 there was given me a reed like unto a rod and the angel stood saying rise and measure the temple of god and the altar and them that worship therein</string>
  <string>
 but the court which is without the temple leave out and measure it not</string>
  <string> for it is given unto the gentiles and the holy city shall they tread under foot forty and two months</string>
  <string>
 i will give power unto my two witnesses and they shall prophesy a thousand two hundred and threescore days clothed in sackcloth</string>
  <string>
 these are the two olive trees and the two candlesticks standing before the god of the earth</string>
  <string>
 if any man will hurt them fire proceedeth out of their mouth and devoureth their enemies and if any man will hurt them he must in this manner be killed</string>
  <string>
 these have power to shut heaven that it rain not in the days of their prophecy and have power over waters to turn them to blood and to smite the earth with all plagues as often as they will</string>
  <string>
 when they shall have finished their testimony the beast that ascendeth out of the bottomless pit shall make war against them and shall overcome them and kill them</string>
  <string>
 their dead bodies shall lie in the street of the great city which spiritually is called sodom and egypt where also our lord was crucified</string>
  <string>
 they of the people and kindreds and tongues and nations shall see their dead bodies three days and an half and shall not suffer their dead bodies to be put in graves</string>
  <string>
 they that dwell upon the earth shall rejoice over them and make merry and shall send gifts one to another</string>
  <string> because these two prophets tormented them that dwelt on the earth</string>
  <string>
 after three days and an half the spirit of life from god entered into them and they stood upon their feet</string>
  <string> and great fear fell upon them which saw them</string>
  <string>
 they heard a great voice from heaven saying unto them come up hither</string>
  <string> they ascended up to heaven in a cloud</string>
  <string> and their enemies beheld them</string>
  <string>
 the same hour was there a great earthquake and the tenth part of the city fell and in the earthquake were slain of men seven thousand and the remnant were affrighted and gave glory to the god of heaven</string>
  <string>
 the second woe is past</string>
  <string> and behold the third woe cometh quickly</string>
  <string>
 the seventh angel sounded</string>
  <string> and there were great voices in heaven saying the kingdoms of this world are become the kingdoms of our lord and of his christ</string>
  <string> and he shall reign for ever and ever</string>
  <string>
 the four and twenty elders which sat before god on their seats fell upon their faces and worshipped god
 saying we give thee thanks o lord god almighty which art and wast and art to come</string>
  <string> because thou hast taken to thee thy great power and hast reigned</string>
  <string>
 the nations were angry and thy wrath is come and the time of the dead that they should be judged and that thou shouldest give reward unto thy servants the prophets and to the saints and them that fear thy name small and great</string>
  <string> and shouldest destroy them which destroy the earth</string>
  <string>
 the temple of god was opened in heaven and there was seen in his temple the ark of his testament and there were lightnings and voices and thunderings and an earthquake and great hail</string>
  <string>
 
 there appeared a great wonder in heaven</string>
  <string> a woman clothed with the sun and the moon under her feet and upon her head a crown of twelve stars
 she being with child cried travailing in birth and pained to be delivered</string>
  <string>
 there appeared another wonder in heaven</string>
  <string> and behold a great red dragon having seven heads and ten horns and seven crowns upon his heads</string>
  <string>
 his tail drew the third part of the stars of heaven and did cast them to the earth and the dragon stood before the woman which was ready to be delivered for to devour her child as soon as it was born</string>
  <string>
 she brought forth a man child who was to rule all nations with a rod of iron and her child was caught up unto god and to his throne</string>
  <string>
 the woman fled into the wilderness where she hath a place prepared of god that they should feed her there a thousand two hundred and threescore days</string>
  <string>
 there was war in heaven michael and his angels fought against the dragon</string>
  <string> and the dragon fought and his angels
 prevailed not</string>
  <string> neither was their place found any more in heaven</string>
  <string>
 the great dragon was cast out that old serpent called the devil and satan which deceiveth the whole world he was cast out into the earth and his angels were cast out with him</string>
  <string>
 i heard a loud voice saying in heaven now is come salvation and strength and the kingdom of our god and the power of his christ for the accuser of our brethren is cast down which accused them before our god day and night</string>
  <string>
 they overcame him by the blood of the lamb and by the word of their testimony</string>
  <string> and they loved not their lives unto the death</string>
  <string>
 therefore rejoice ye heavens and ye that dwell in them</string>
  <string> woe to the inhabiters of the earth and of the sea</string>
  <string> for the devil is come down unto you having great wrath because he knoweth that he hath but a short time</string>
  <string>
 when the dragon saw that he was cast unto the earth he persecuted the woman which brought forth the man child </string>
  <string>
 to the woman were given two wings of a great eagle that she might fly into the wilderness into her place where she is nourished for a time and times and half a time from the face of the serpent</string>
  <string>
 the serpent cast out of his mouth water as a flood after the woman that he might cause her to be carried away of the flood</string>
  <string>
 the earth helped the woman and the earth opened her mouth and swallowed up the flood which the dragon cast out of his mouth</string>
  <string>
 the dragon was wroth with the woman and went to make war with the remnant of her seed which keep the commandments of god and have the testimony of jesus christ</string>
  <string>
 
 i stood upon the sand of the sea and saw a beast rise up out of the sea having seven heads and ten horns and upon his horns ten crowns and upon his heads the name of blasphemy</string>
  <string>
 the beast which i saw was like unto a leopard and his feet were as the feet of a bear and his mouth as the mouth of a lion and the dragon gave him his power and his seat and great authority</string>
  <string>
 i saw one of his heads as it were wounded to death</string>
  <string> and his deadly wound was healed and all the world wondered after the beast</string>
  <string>
 they worshipped the dragon which gave power unto the beast and they worshipped the beast saying who is like unto the beast</string>
  <string> who is able to make war with him</string>
  <string>
 there was given unto him a mouth speaking great things and blasphemies</string>
  <string> and power was given unto him to continue forty and two months</string>
  <string>
 he opened his mouth in blasphemy against god to blaspheme his name and his tabernacle and them that dwell in heaven</string>
  <string>
 it was given unto him to make war with the saints and to overcome them and power was given him over all kindreds and tongues and nations</string>
  <string>
 all that dwell upon the earth shall worship him whose names are not written in the book of life of the lamb slain from the foundation of the world</string>
  <string>
 if any man have an ear let him hear</string>
  <string>
 he that leadeth into captivity shall go into captivity he that killeth with the sword must be killed with the sword</string>
  <string> here is the patience and the faith of the saints</string>
  <string>
 i beheld another beast coming up out of the earth</string>
  <string> and he had two horns like a lamb and he spake as a dragon</string>
  <string>
 he exerciseth all the power of the first beast before him and causeth the earth and them which dwell therein to worship the first beast whose deadly wound was healed</string>
  <string>
 he doeth great wonders so that he maketh fire come down from heaven on the earth in the sight of men
 deceiveth them that dwell on the earth by the means of those miracles which he had power to do in the sight of the beast</string>
  <string> saying to them that dwell on the earth that they should make an image to the beast which had the wound by a sword and did live</string>
  <string>
 he had power to give life unto the image of the beast that the image of the beast should both speak and cause that as many as would not worship the image of the beast should be killed</string>
  <string>
 he causeth all both small and great rich and poor free and bond to receive a mark in their right hand or in their foreheads
 that no man might buy or sell save he that had the mark or the name of the beast or the number of his name</string>
  <string>
 here is wisdom</string>
  <string> let him that hath understanding count the number of the beast for it is the number of a man</string>
  <string> and his number is six hundred threescore and six</string>
  <string>
 
 i looked and lo a lamb stood on the mount sion and with him an hundred forty and four thousand having his father's name written in their foreheads</string>
  <string>
 i heard a voice from heaven as the voice of many waters and as the voice of a great thunder and i heard the voice of harpers harping with their harps
 they sung as it were a new song before the throne and before the four beasts and the elders and no man could learn that song but the hundred and forty and four thousand which were redeemed from the earth</string>
  <string>
 these are they which were not defiled with women</string>
  <string> for they are virgins</string>
  <string> these are they which follow the lamb whithersoever he goeth</string>
  <string> these were redeemed from among men being the firstfruits unto god and to the lamb</string>
  <string>
 in their mouth was found no guile for they are without fault before the throne of god</string>
  <string>
 i saw another angel fly in the midst of heaven having the everlasting gospel to preach unto them that dwell on the earth and to every nation and kindred and tongue and people
 saying with a loud voice fear god and give glory to him</string>
  <string> for the hour of his judgment is come and worship him that made heaven and earth and the sea and the fountains of waters</string>
  <string>
 there followed another angel saying babylon is fallen is fallen that great city because she made all nations drink of the wine of the wrath of her fornication</string>
  <string>
 the third angel followed them saying with a loud voice if any man worship the beast and his image and receive his mark in his forehead or in his hand
 the same shall drink of the wine of the wrath of god which is poured out without mixture into the cup of his indignation</string>
  <string> and he shall be tormented with fire and brimstone in the presence of the holy angels and in the presence of the lamb
 the smoke of their torment ascendeth up for ever and ever and they have no rest day nor night who worship the beast and his image and whosoever receiveth the mark of his name</string>
  <string>
 here is the patience of the saints here are they that keep the commandments of god and the faith of jesus</string>
  <string>
 i heard a voice from heaven saying unto me write blessed are the dead which die in the lord from henceforth yea saith the spirit that they may rest from their labours</string>
  <string> and their works do follow them</string>
  <string>
 i looked and behold a white cloud and upon the cloud one sat like unto the son of man having on his head a golden crown and in his hand a sharp sickle</string>
  <string>
 another angel came out of the temple crying with a loud voice to him that sat on the cloud thrust in thy sickle and reap for the time is come for thee to reap</string>
  <string> for the harvest of the earth is ripe</string>
  <string>
 he that sat on the cloud thrust in his sickle on the earth</string>
  <string> and the earth was reaped</string>
  <string>
 another angel came out of the temple which is in heaven he also having a sharp sickle</string>
  <string>
 another angel came out from the altar which had power over fire</string>
  <string> and cried with a loud cry to him that had the sharp sickle saying thrust in thy sharp sickle and gather the clusters of the vine of the earth</string>
  <string> for her grapes are fully ripe</string>
  <string>
 the angel thrust in his sickle into the earth and gathered the vine of the earth and cast it into the great winepress of the wrath of god</string>
  <string>
 the winepress was trodden without the city and blood came out of the winepress even unto the horse bridles by the space of a thousand and six hundred furlongs</string>
  <string>
 
 i saw another sign in heaven great and marvellous seven angels having the seven last plagues</string>
  <string> for in them is filled up the wrath of god</string>
  <string>
 i saw as it were a sea of glass mingled with fire and them that had gotten the victory over the beast and over his image and over his mark and over the number of his name stand on the sea of glass having the harps of god</string>
  <string>
 they sing the song of moses the servant of god and the song of the lamb saying great and marvellous are thy works lord god almighty</string>
  <string> just and true are thy ways thou king of saints</string>
  <string>
 who shall not fear thee o lord and glorify thy name</string>
  <string> for thou only art holy for all nations shall come and worship before thee</string>
  <string> for thy judgments are made manifest</string>
  <string>
 after that i looked and behold the temple of the tabernacle of the testimony in heaven was opened
 the seven angels came out of the temple having the seven plagues clothed in pure and white linen and having their breasts girded with golden girdles</string>
  <string>
 one of the four beasts gave unto the seven angels seven golden vials full of the wrath of god who liveth for ever and ever</string>
  <string>
 the temple was filled with smoke from the glory of god and from his power</string>
  <string> and no man was able to enter into the temple till the seven plagues of the seven angels were fulfilled</string>
  <string>
 
 i heard a great voice out of the temple saying to the seven angels go your ways and pour out the vials of the wrath of god upon the earth</string>
  <string>
 the first went and poured out his vial upon the earth</string>
  <string> and there fell a noisome and grievous sore upon the men which had the mark of the beast and upon them which worshipped his image</string>
  <string>
 the second angel poured out his vial upon the sea</string>
  <string> and it became as the blood of a dead man  and every living soul died in the sea</string>
  <string>
 the third angel poured out his vial upon the rivers and fountains of waters</string>
  <string> and they became blood</string>
  <string>
 i heard the angel of the waters say thou art righteous o lord which art and wast and shalt be because thou hast judged thus</string>
  <string>
 for they have shed the blood of saints and prophets and thou hast given them blood to drink</string>
  <string> for they are worthy</string>
  <string>
 i heard another out of the altar say even so lord god almighty true and righteous are thy judgments</string>
  <string>
 the fourth angel poured out his vial upon the sun</string>
  <string> and power was given unto him to scorch men with fire</string>
  <string>
 men were scorched with great heat and blasphemed the name of god which hath power over these plagues and they repented not to give him glory</string>
  <string>
 the fifth angel poured out his vial upon the seat of the beast</string>
  <string> and his kingdom was full of darkness</string>
  <string> and they gnawed their tongues for pain
 blasphemed the god of heaven because of their pains and their sores and repented not of their deeds</string>
  <string>
 the sixth angel poured out his vial upon the great river euphrates</string>
  <string> and the water thereof was dried up that the way of the kings of the east might be prepared</string>
  <string>
 i saw three unclean spirits like frogs come out of the mouth of the dragon and out of the mouth of the beast and out of the mouth of the false prophet</string>
  <string>
 for they are the spirits of devils working miracles which go forth unto the kings of the earth and of the whole world to gather them to the battle of that great day of god almighty</string>
  <string>
 behold i come as a thief</string>
  <string> blessed is he that watcheth and keepeth his garments lest he walk naked and they see his shame</string>
  <string>
 he gathered them together into a place called in the hebrew tongue armageddon</string>
  <string>
 the seventh angel poured out his vial into the air</string>
  <string> and there came a great voice out of the temple of heaven from the throne saying it is done</string>
  <string>
 there were voices and thunders and lightnings</string>
  <string> and there was a great earthquake such as was not since men were upon the earth so mighty an earthquake and so great</string>
  <string>
 the great city was divided into three parts and the cities of the nations fell and great babylon came in remembrance before god to give unto her the cup of the wine of the fierceness of his wrath</string>
  <string>
 every island fled away and the mountains were not found</string>
  <string>
 there fell upon men a great hail out of heaven every stone about the weight of a talent and men blasphemed god because of the plague of the hail</string>
  <string> for the plague thereof was exceeding great</string>
  <string>
 
 there came one of the seven angels which had the seven vials and talked with me saying unto me come hither</string>
  <string> i will shew unto thee the judgment of the great whore that sitteth upon many waters
 with whom the kings of the earth have committed fornication and the inhabitants of the earth have been made drunk with the wine of her fornication</string>
  <string>
 so he carried me away in the spirit into the wilderness and i saw a woman sit upon a scarlet coloured beast full of names of blasphemy having seven heads and ten horns</string>
  <string>
 the woman was arrayed in purple and scarlet colour and decked with gold and precious stones and pearls having a golden cup in her hand full of abominations and filthiness of her fornication
 upon her forehead was a name written mystery babylon the great the mother of harlots and abominations of the earth</string>
  <string>
 i saw the woman drunken with the blood of the saints and with the blood of the martyrs of jesus and when i saw her i wondered with great admiration</string>
  <string>
 the angel said unto me wherefore didst thou marvel</string>
  <string> i will tell thee the mystery of the woman and of the beast that carrieth her which hath the seven heads and ten horns</string>
  <string>
 the beast that thou sawest was and is not</string>
  <string> and shall ascend out of the bottomless pit and go into perdition and they that dwell on the earth shall wonder whose names were not written in the book of life from the foundation of the world when they behold the beast that was and is not and yet is</string>
  <string>
 here is the mind which hath wisdom</string>
  <string> the seven heads are seven mountains on which the woman sitteth</string>
  <string>
 there are seven kings five are fallen and one is and the other is not yet come</string>
  <string> and when he cometh he must continue a short space</string>
  <string>
 the beast that was and is not even he is the eighth and is of the seven and goeth into perdition</string>
  <string>
 the ten horns which thou sawest are ten kings which have received no kingdom as yet</string>
  <string> but receive power as kings one hour with the beast</string>
  <string>
 these have one mind and shall give their power and strength unto the beast</string>
  <string>
 these shall make war with the lamb and the lamb shall overcome them for he is lord of lords and king of kings and they that are with him are called and chosen and faithful</string>
  <string>
 he saith unto me the waters which thou sawest where the whore sitteth are peoples and multitudes and nations and tongues</string>
  <string>
 the ten horns which thou sawest upon the beast these shall hate the whore and shall make her desolate and naked and shall eat her flesh and burn her with fire</string>
  <string>
 for god hath put in their hearts to fulfil his will and to agree and give their kingdom unto the beast until the words of god shall be fulfilled</string>
  <string>
 the woman which thou sawest is that great city which reigneth over the kings of the earth</string>
  <string>
 
 after these things i saw another angel come down from heaven having great power</string>
  <string> and the earth was lightened with his glory</string>
  <string>
 he cried mightily with a strong voice saying babylon the great is fallen is fallen and is become the habitation of devils and the hold of every foul spirit and a cage of every unclean and hateful bird</string>
  <string>
 for all nations have drunk of the wine of the wrath of her fornication and the kings of the earth have committed fornication with her and the merchants of the earth are waxed rich through the abundance of her delicacies</string>
  <string>
 i heard another voice from heaven saying come out of her my people that ye be not partakers of her sins and that ye receive not of her plagues</string>
  <string>
 for her sins have reached unto heaven and god hath remembered her iniquities</string>
  <string>
 reward her even as she rewarded you and double unto her double according to her works in the cup which she hath filled fill to her double</string>
  <string>
 how much she hath glorified herself and lived deliciously so much torment and sorrow give her for she saith in her heart i sit a queen and am no widow and shall see no sorrow</string>
  <string>
 therefore shall her plagues come in one day death and mourning and famine</string>
  <string> and she shall be utterly burned with fire for strong is the lord god who judgeth her</string>
  <string>
 the kings of the earth who have committed fornication and lived deliciously with her shall bewail her and lament for her when they shall see the smoke of her burning
 standing afar off for the fear of her torment saying alas alas that great city babylon that mighty city</string>
  <string> for in one hour is thy judgment come</string>
  <string>
 the merchants of the earth shall weep and mourn over her</string>
  <string> for no man buyeth their merchandise any more
 the merchandise of gold and silver and precious stones and of pearls and fine linen and purple and silk and scarlet and all thyine wood and all manner vessels of ivory and all manner vessels of most precious wood and of brass and iron and marble
 cinnamon and odours and ointments and frankincense and wine and oil and fine flour and wheat and beasts and sheep and horses and chariots and slaves and souls of men</string>
  <string>
 the fruits that thy soul lusted after are departed from thee and all things which were dainty and goodly are departed from thee and thou shalt find them no more at all</string>
  <string>
 the merchants of these things which were made rich by her shall stand afar off for the fear of her torment weeping and wailing
 saying alas alas that great city that was clothed in fine linen and purple and scarlet and decked with gold and precious stones and pearls</string>
  <string>
 for in one hour so great riches is come to nought</string>
  <string> every shipmaster and all the company in ships and sailors and as many as trade by sea stood afar off
 cried when they saw the smoke of her burning saying what city is like unto this great city</string>
  <string>
 they cast dust on their heads and cried weeping and wailing saying alas alas that great city wherein were made rich all that had ships in the sea by reason of her costliness</string>
  <string> for in one hour is she made desolate</string>
  <string>
 rejoice over her thou heaven and ye holy apostles and prophets</string>
  <string> for god hath avenged you on her</string>
  <string>
 a mighty angel took up a stone like a great millstone and cast it into the sea saying thus with violence shall that great city babylon be thrown down and shall be found no more at all</string>
  <string>
 the voice of harpers and musicians and of pipers and trumpeters shall be heard no more at all in thee</string>
  <string> and no craftsman of whatsoever craft he be shall be found any more in thee</string>
  <string> and the sound of a millstone shall be heard no more at all in thee</string>
  <string>
 the light of a candle shall shine no more at all in thee</string>
  <string> and the voice of the bridegroom and of the bride shall be heard no more at all in thee for thy merchants were the great men of the earth</string>
  <string> for by thy sorceries were all nations deceived</string>
  <string>
 in her was found the blood of prophets and of saints and of all that were slain upon the earth</string>
  <string>
 
 after these things i heard a great voice of much people in heaven saying alleluia</string>
  <string> salvation and glory and honour and power unto the lord our god
 for true and righteous are his judgments for he hath judged the great whore which did corrupt the earth with her fornication and hath avenged the blood of his servants at her hand</string>
  <string>
 again they said alleluia</string>
  <string> her smoke rose up for ever and ever</string>
  <string>
 the four and twenty elders and the four beasts fell down and worshipped god that sat on the throne saying amen</string>
  <string> alleluia</string>
  <string>
 a voice came out of the throne saying praise our god all ye his servants and ye that fear him both small and great</string>
  <string>
 i heard as it were the voice of a great multitude and as the voice of many waters and as the voice of mighty thunderings saying alleluia for the lord god omnipotent reigneth</string>
  <string>
 let us be glad and rejoice and give honour to him for the marriage of the lamb is come and his wife hath made herself ready</string>
  <string>
 to her was granted that she should be arrayed in fine linen clean and white for the fine linen is the righteousness of saints</string>
  <string>
 he saith unto me write blessed are they which are called unto the marriage supper of the lamb</string>
  <string> he saith unto me these are the true sayings of god</string>
  <string>
 i fell at his feet to worship him</string>
  <string> he said unto me see thou do it not i am thy fellowservant and of thy brethren that have the testimony of jesus worship god for the testimony of jesus is the spirit of prophecy</string>
  <string>
 i saw heaven opened and behold a white horse</string>
  <string> and he that sat upon him was called faithful and true and in righteousness he doth judge and make war</string>
  <string>
 his eyes were as a flame of fire and on his head were many crowns</string>
  <string> and he had a name written that no man knew but he himself</string>
  <string>
 he was clothed with a vesture dipped in blood and his name is called the word of god</string>
  <string>
 the armies which were in heaven followed him upon white horses clothed in fine linen white and clean</string>
  <string>
 out of his mouth goeth a sharp sword that with it he should smite the nations and he shall rule them with a rod of iron and he treadeth the winepress of the fierceness and wrath of almighty god</string>
  <string>
 he hath on his vesture and on his thigh a name written king of kings and lord of lords</string>
  <string>
 i saw an angel standing in the sun</string>
  <string> and he cried with a loud voice saying to all the fowls that fly in the midst of heaven come and gather yourselves together unto the supper of the great god</string>
  <string>
 that ye may eat the flesh of kings and the flesh of captains and the flesh of mighty men and the flesh of horses and of them that sit on them and the flesh of all men both free and bond both small and great</string>
  <string>
 i saw the beast and the kings of the earth and their armies gathered together to make war against him that sat on the horse and against his army</string>
  <string>
 the beast was taken and with him the false prophet that wrought miracles before him with which he deceived them that had received the mark of the beast and them that worshipped his image</string>
  <string> these both were cast alive into a lake of fire burning with brimstone</string>
  <string>
 the remnant were slain with the sword of him that sat upon the horse which sword proceeded out of his mouth and all the fowls were filled with their flesh</string>
  <string>
 
 i saw an angel come down from heaven having the key of the bottomless pit and a great chain in his hand</string>
  <string>
 he laid hold on the dragon that old serpent which is the devil and satan and bound him a thousand years
 cast him into the bottomless pit and shut him up and set a seal upon him that he should deceive the nations no more till the thousand years should be fulfilled and after that he must be loosed a little season</string>
  <string>
 i saw thrones and they sat upon them and judgment was given unto them and i saw the souls of them that were beheaded for the witness of jesus and for the word of god and which had not worshipped the beast neither his image neither had received his mark upon their foreheads or in their hands</string>
  <string> and they lived and reigned with christ a thousand years</string>

  <string> and the books were opened and another book was opened which is the book of life and the dead were judged out of those things which were written in the books according to their works</string>

  <string>
 god shall wipe away all tears from their eyes</string>
  <string> and there shall be no more death neither sorrow nor crying neither shall there be any more pain for the former things are passed away</string>

 there came unto me one of the seven angels which had the seven vials full of the seven last plagues and talked with me saying come hither i will shew thee the bride the lamb's wife</string>
  <string>
 he carried me away in the spirit to a great and high mountain and shewed me that great city the holy jerusalem descending out of heaven from god
 having the glory of god and her light was like unto a stone most precious even like a jasper stone clear as crystal</string>

  <string>
 the gates of it shall not be shut at all by day for there shall be no night there</string>
  <string>

  <string>
 there shall in no wise enter into it any thing that defileth neither whatsoever worketh abomination or maketh a lie but they which are written in the lamb's book of life</string>
