        <h5>The Discrete Vertex Guarding Problem in Monotone Polygons</h5>
        Abstract: <br />
        In computational geometry, the discrete vertex guarding problem is a
        visibility problem involves <br />
        <br />
        picking a finite set of points that can “see” all internal vertices of the
        polygon. A polygon is considered to be monotone if a vertical line, drawn
        through the polygon, will touch the boundary at most twice. The terrain T
        is a set of m vertices {v1, v2, …, vm}. A vertex vi is defined by the
        coordinates (xi, yi) in
        euclidean space. The vertices are ordered in the manner of vi < vi+1. A
        line segment is from vi to vi+1, for where i &lt; m, and there is a line segment
        from vm to v1 to form a polygon. The goal of this project is to
        produce a set of vertices that provide a good solution for a large polygon
        very quickly and consistently. The motivation is this problem is NP
        Complete, and the perfect solution could take until the heat death of the
        universe, given that n is sufficiently large. In order to combat time as a
        constraint, we sacrifice a little bit of precision.

        Normally, you take your lectures in the classroom, and do your homework at home.
        Flipped means you do the opposite. Hopefully, I'll be uploading some videos with
        sample homework.
